        <h1>Commenting PDFs</h1>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/pdf-editor.aspx?docs=download" target="_blank" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>PDF Editor</b></a> allows you to maintain a constant team-wide approach to work flow: <a href="https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/userguides/groups-guides-documents-share-documents.aspx" target="_blank" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">share</a> files and folders, <a href="../HelpfulHints/Communicating.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">communicate</a> right in the editor.</p>
        <p>In the <b>PDF Editor</b> you can leave comments on the content of PDFs without actually editing it. Unlike <a href="../HelpfulHints/Communicating.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">chat</a> messages, comments stay until deleted.</p>
