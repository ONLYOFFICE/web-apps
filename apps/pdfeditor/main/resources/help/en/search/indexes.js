If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc. The Default cache mode setting applies the two above-mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers: When the Default cache mode setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the second cache mode, other browsers use the first cache mode. When the Default cache mode setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the first cache mode, other browsers use the second cache mode.
