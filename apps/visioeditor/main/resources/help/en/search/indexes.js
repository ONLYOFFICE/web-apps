The Classic Light color scheme incorporates standard red brick, white, and light gray colors. The Dark color scheme incorporates black, dark gray, and light gray colors suitable for working at night. The Contrast Dark color scheme incorporates black, dark gray, and white colors with more contrast in UI elements, highlighting the working area of the file. The Gray color scheme incorporates lighter gray color and appears as a uniformly light color scheme. The Tab style option is used to change tab highlighting type: Fill to fill the selected tab with a darker colour, or Line to underline the selected tab. The Use toolbar color as tabs background option is used to fill the tabs with the same colour as the tab background interface. Workspace The Turn on screen reader support option is used to enable support of screen reader software. The Use Alt key to navigate the user interface using the keyboard option is used to enable using the Alt / Option key in keyboard shortcuts. The Default Zoom Value option is used to set the default zoom value, selecting it in the list of available options from 50% to 500%. You can also choose the Fit to Page, Fit to Width, or Last Used option. The Last Used option refers to the last set scaling during the current session. The Font Hinting option is used to select how fonts are displayed in the Diagram Viewer. Choose As Windows if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on Windows, i.e., using Windows font hinting. Choose As OS X if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on a Mac, i.e., without any font hinting at all. Choose Native if you want your text to be displayed with hinting embedded into font files. Default cache mode - used to select the cache mode for the font characters. It’s not recommended to switch it without any reason. It can be helpful in some cases only, for example, when an issue in the Google Chrome browser with enabled hardware acceleration occurs. The Diagram Viewer has two cache modes: In the first cache mode, each letter is cached as a separate picture. In the second cache mode, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically, and a mechanism for allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc. The Default cache mode setting applies the two above-mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers: When the Default cache mode setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the second cache mode, other browsers use the first cache mode. When the Default cache mode setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the first cache mode, other browsers use the second cache mode. To save the changes you made, click the Apply button."
