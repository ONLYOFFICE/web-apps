                            <b>Default cache mode</b> - used to select the cache mode for the font characters. It’s not recommended to switch it without any reason. It can be helpful in some cases only, for example, when the Google Chrome browser has problems with the enabled hardware acceleration.
                            <p>The Presentation Editor has two cache modes:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In the <b>first cache mode</b>, each letter is cached as a separate picture.</li>
                                <li>In the <b>second cache mode</b>, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically and a mechanism of allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The <b>Default cache mode</b> setting applies two above-mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When the <b>Default cache mode</b> setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the <b>second cache mode</b>, other browsers use the <b>first cache mode</b>.</li>
                                <li>When the <b>Default cache mode</b> setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the <b>first cache mode</b>, other browsers use the <b>second cache mode</b>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Macros settings</b> option is used to set macros display with a notification.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose <b>Disable All</b> to disable all macros within the presentation.</li>
                        <li>Choose <b>Show notification</b> to receive notifications about macros within the presentation.</li>
                        <li>Choose <b>Enable all</b> to automatically run all macros within the presentation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The changes are saved as you go.</p>
