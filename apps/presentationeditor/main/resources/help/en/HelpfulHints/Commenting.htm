			<h1>Commenting</h1>
			<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/presentation-editor.aspx" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Presentation Editor</b></a> allows you to maintain constant team-wide approach to work flow: <a href="https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/userguides/groups-guides-documents-share-documents.aspx" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">share</a> files and folders, <a href="../HelpfulHints/CollaborativeEditing.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">collaborate</a> on presentations in real time, <a href="../HelpfulHints/UsingChat.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">communicate</a> right in the editor, save <a href="../HelpfulHints/VersionHistory.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">presentation versions</a> for future use.</p>
			<p>In <b>Presentation Editor</b> you can leave comments to the content of presentations without actually editing it. Unlike <a href="../HelpfulHints/UsingChat.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">chat messages</a>, the comments stay until deleted.</p>
			<h3>Leaving comments and replying to them</h3>
			<p>To leave a comment to a certain object (text box, shape, etc.):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>select an object where you think there is an error or problem,</li>
				<li>
					switch to the <b>Insert</b> or <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar and click the <div class="icon icon-comment_toptoolbar"></div> <b>Comment</b> button, or<br />
					use the <div class="icon icon-commentsicon"></div> icon on the left sidebar to open the <b>Comments</b> panel, and either click the <b>Add comment</b> button in the top toolbar of the panel, or click the <b>More</b> symbol and choose the <b>Add Comment to Document</b> option to leave a comment to the whole presentation, or<br />
					right-click the selected object and select the <b>Add Сomment</b> option from the menu,<br />
				</li>
				<li>enter the needed text,</li>
				<li>click the <b>Add Comment/Add</b> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The object you commented will be marked with the <span class="icon icon-added_comment_icon"></span> icon. To view the comment, just click on this icon.</p>
			<p>To add a comment to a certain slide, select the slide and use the <span class="icon icon-comment_toptoolbar"></span> <b>Comment</b> button on the <b>Insert</b> or <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar. The added comment will be displayed in the upper left corner of the slide.</p>
			<p>To create a presentation-level comment which is not related to a certain object or slide, click the <span class="icon icon-commentsicon"></span> icon on the left sidebar to open the <b>Comments</b> panel and use the <b>Add Comment to Document</b> link. The presentation-level comments can be viewed on the <b>Comments</b> panel. Comments related to objects and slides are also available here.</p>
			<p>Any other user can answer to the added comment asking questions or reporting on the work they have done. For this purpose, click the <b>Add Reply</b> link situated under the comment, type in your reply text in the entry field and press the <b>Reply</b> button.</p>
			<p>If you are using the <b>Strict</b> co-editing mode, new comments added by other users will become visible only after you click the <span class="icon icon-saveupdate"></span> icon in the left upper corner of the top toolbar.</p>
			<h3>Managing comments</h3>
			<p>You can manage the added comments using the icons in the comment balloon or on the <b>Comments</b> panel on the left:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					sort the added comments by clicking the <div class="icon icon-sortcommentsicon"></div> icon:
					<ul>
						<li>by date: <b>Newest</b> or <b>Oldest</b>.</li>
						<li>by author: <b>Author from A to Z</b> or <b>Author from Z to A</b>.</li>
						<li>
							by group: <b>All</b> or choose a certain group from the list. This sorting option is available if you are running a version that includes this functionality.

				<li>delete the currently selected by clicking the <div class="icon icon-deletecommenticon"></div> icon,</li>

To open it again, click the <div class="icon icon-resolvedicon"></div> icon,</li>
				<li>if you want to manage comments in a bunch, open the <b>Resolve</b> drop-down menu on the <b>Collaboration</b> tab. Select one of the options for resolving comments: <b>resolve current comments</b>, <b>resolve my comments</b> or <b>resolve all comments</b> in the presentation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Adding mentions</h3>
			<p class="note">You can only add mentions to the comments made to the presentation content and not to the presentation itself.</p>
			<p>When entering comments, you can use the <b>mentions</b> feature that allows you to attract somebody's attention to the comment and send a notification to the mentioned user via email and <b>Talk</b>.</p>
			<p>To add a mention,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Enter the "+" or "@" sign anywhere in the comment text - a list of the portal users will open. To simplify the search process, you can start typing a name in the comment field - the user list will change as you type.</li>
				<li>Select the necessary person from the list. If the file has not yet been shared with the mentioned user, the <b>Sharing Settings</b> window will open. <b>Read only</b> access type is selected by default. <a href="https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/userguides/groups-guides-documents-share-documents.aspx" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">Change it if necessary</a>.</li>
				<li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The mentioned user will receive an email notification that they have been mentioned in a comment. If the file has been shared, the user will also receive a corresponding notification.</p>
			<h3>Removing comments</h3>
			<p>To remove comments,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>click the <div class="icon icon-removecomment_toptoolbar"></div> <b>Remove</b> button on the <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar,</li>
				<li>
					select the necessary option from the menu:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Remove Current Comments</b> - to remove the currently selected comment. If some replies have been added to the comment, all its replies will be removed as well.</li>
						<li><b>Remove My Comments</b> - to remove comments you added without removing comments added by other users. If some replies have been added to your comment, all its replies will be removed as well.</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
