Choose As OS X if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on a Mac, i.e. without any font hinting at all. Choose Native if you want your text to be displayed with the hinting embedded into font files. Default cache mode - used to select the cache mode for the font characters. It’s not recommended to switch it without any reason. It can be helpful in some cases only, for example, when the Google Chrome browser has problems with the enabled hardware acceleration. The Presentation Editor has two cache modes: In the first cache mode, each letter is cached as a separate picture. In the second cache mode, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically and a mechanism of allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc. The Default cache mode setting applies two above-mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers: When the Default cache mode setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the second cache mode, other browsers use the first cache mode. When the Default cache mode setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the first cache mode, other browsers use the second cache mode. The Macros settings option is used to set macros display with a notification. Choose Disable All to disable all macros within the presentation. Choose Show notification to receive notifications about macros within the presentation. Choose Enable all to automatically run all macros within the presentation. The changes are saved as you go."

Add a new equation To insert an equation from the gallery, put the cursor where you want to place the equation, switch to the Insert tab of the top toolbar, click the arrow next to the Equation icon on the top toolbar, select the required equation category in the toolbar above the inserted equation, or in the opened drop-down list select the equation category you need. The following categories are currently available: Symbols, Fractions, Scripts, Radicals, Integrals, Large Operators, Brackets, Functions, Accents, Limits and Logarithms, Operators, Matrices, click the Equation Settings symbol in the toolbar above the inserted equation to access more settings, e.g., Unicode or LaTeX, Professional or Linear, click the certain symbol/equation in the corresponding set of templates, to hide the toolbar, click the Hide Equation Toolbar option in the Equation Settings. The selected symbol/equation box will be inserted in the center of the current slide. If you do not see the equation box border, click anywhere within the equation - the border will be displayed as a dashed line. The equation box can be freely moved, resized or rotated on the slide. To do that, click on the equation box border (it will be displayed as a solid line) and use the corresponding handles. Each equation template represents a set of slots. A slot is a position for each element that makes up the equation. An empty slot (also called as a placeholder) has a dotted outline . You need to fill in all the placeholders specifying the necessary values. Enter values The insertion point specifies where the next character you enter will appear. To position the insertion point precisely, click within a placeholder and use the keyboard arrows to move the insertion point one character left/right. Once the insertion point is positioned, you can fill in the placeholder: enter the desired numeric/literal value using the keyboard, insert a special character using the Symbols palette from the Equation menu on the Insert tab of the top toolbar or typing them from the keyboard (see the Math AutoСorrect option description), add another equation template from the palette to create a complex nested equation. The size of the primary equation will be automatically adjusted to fit its content. The size of the nested equation elements depends on the primary equation placeholder size, but it cannot be smaller than the sub-subscript size. To add some new equation elements, you can also use the right-click menu options: To add a new argument that goes before or after the existing one within Brackets, you can right-click on the existing argument and select the Insert argument before/after option from the menu. To add a new equation within Cases with several conditions from the Brackets group, you can right-click on an empty placeholder or entered equation within it and select the Insert equation before/after option from the menu. To add a new row or a column in a Matrix, you can right-click on a placeholder within it, select the Insert option from the menu, then select Row Above/Below or Column Left/Right. Note: currently, equations cannot be entered using the linear format, i.e. \\sqrt(4&x^3). When entering the values of mathematical expressions, you do not need to use Spacebar because spaces between the characters and signs of operations are set automatically. If the equation is too long and does not fit to a single line within the text box, automatic line breaking appears while you are typing. You can also insert a line break in a specific position by right-clicking on a mathematical operator and selecting the Insert manual break option from the menu. The selected operator will start a new line. To delete the added manual line break, right-click on the mathematical operator that starts a new line and select the Delete manual break option. Format equations By default, the equation within the text box is horizontally centered and vertically aligned to the top of the text box. To change its horizontal/vertical alignment, put the cursor within the the equation box (the text box borders will be displayed as dashed lines) and use the corresponding icons on the Home tab of the top toolbar. To increase or decrease the equation font size, click anywhere within the equation box and select the necessary font size from the list on the Home tab of the top toolbar.

        "body": "Insert your text box into a presentation In the Presentation Editor, you can add new text in three different ways: Add a text passage within the corresponding text placeholder on the slide layout. To do that, just put the cursor within the placeholder and type in your text or paste it using the Ctrl+V key combination instead of the default text. Add a text passage anywhere on a slide. You can insert a text box (a rectangular frame that allows you to enter some text within it) or a Text Art object (a text box with a predefined font style and color that allows you to apply some text effects). Depending on the necessary text object type, you can do the following: to add a text box, click the Text Box icon on the Home or Insert tab of the top toolbar, choose one of the following options: Insert horizontal text box or Insert vertical text box, then click where you want to insert the text box, hold the mouse button and drag the text box border to specify its size. When you release the mouse button, the insertion point will appear in the added text box, allowing you to enter your text. It's also possible to insert a text box by clicking the Shape icon on the top toolbar and selecting the shape from the Basic Shapes group. to add a Text Art object, click the Text Art icon on the Insert tab of the top toolbar, then click on the desired style template – the Text Art object will be added in the center of the slide. Select the default text within the text box with the mouse and replace it with your own text. Add a text passage within an autoshape. Select a shape and start typing your text. Click outside of the text object to apply the changes and return to the slide. The text within the text object is a part of the latter (when you move or rotate the text object, the text moves or rotates with it). As an inserted text object represents a rectangular frame (it has invisible text box borders by default) with text in it and this frame is a common autoshape, you can change both the shape and text properties. You can save the text box as a picture on your hard drive using the Save as picture option in the right-click menu. To delete the added text object, click on the text box border and press the Delete key. The text within the text box will also be deleted. Format a text box Select the text box by clicking on its border to change its properties. When the text box is selected, its borders are displayed as solid (not dashed) lines. to resize, move, rotate the text box, use the special handles on the edges of the shape. to edit the text box fill, line, replace the rectangular box with a different shape, or access the shape advanced settings, click the Shape settings icon on the right sidebar and use the corresponding options. to align a text box on the slide, rotate or flip it, arrange text boxes as related to other objects, right-click on the text box border, and use the contextual menu options. to create columns of text within the text box, click the corresponding icon on the text formatting toolbar and choose the preferable option, or right-click on the text box border, click the Shape Advanced Settings option, and switch to the Columns tab in the Shape - Advanced Settings window. Format the text within the text box Click the text within the text box to change its properties. When the text is selected, the text box borders are displayed as dashed lines. Note: it's also possible to change text formatting when the text box (not the text itself) is selected. In such a case, any changes will be applied to the whole text within the text box. Some font formatting options (font type, size, color, and decoration styles) can be applied to the previously selected part of the text separately. Align your text within the text box The text is aligned horizontally in four ways: left, right, center, or justified. To do that: place the cursor in the position where you want the alignment to be applied (this can be a new line or already entered text), drop-down the Horizontal align list on the Home tab of the top toolbar, select the alignment type you would like to apply: the Align text left option allows you to line up your text on the left side of the text box (the right side remains unaligned). the Align text center option allows you to line up your text in the center of the text box (the right and the left sides remain unaligned). the Align text right option allows you to line up your text on the right side of the text box (the left side remains unaligned). the Justify option allows you to line up your text both on the left and on the right sides of the text box (additional spacing is added where necessary to keep the alignment). Note: these parameters can also be found in the Paragraph - Advanced Settings window. The text is aligned vertically in three ways: top, middle, or bottom. To do that: place the cursor in the position where you want the alignment to be applied (this can be a new line or already entered text), drop-down the Vertical align list on the Home tab of the top toolbar, select the alignment type you would like to apply: the Align text to the top option allows you to line up your text to the top of the text box. the Align text to the middle option allows you to line up your text in the center of the text box. the Align text to the bottom option allows you to line up your text to the bottom of the text box. Change the text direction To Rotate the text within the text box, right-click the text, select the Text Direction option, and then choose one of the available options: Horizontal (selected by default), Rotate Text Down (used to set a vertical direction, from top to bottom) or Rotate Text Up (used to set a vertical direction, from bottom to top). Adjust font type, size, color and apply decoration styles You can select the font type, size, and color as well as apply various font decoration styles using the corresponding icons situated on the Home tab of the top toolbar. Note: in case you want to apply the formatting to the text already present in the presentation, select it with the mouse or use the keyboard and apply the formatting. You can also place the mouse cursor within the necessary word to apply the formatting to this word only. Font Used to select one of the fonts from the list of available ones. If the required font is not available in the list, you can download and install it on your operating system, and the font will be available for use in the desktop version.
