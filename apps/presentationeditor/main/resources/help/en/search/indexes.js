You can also click the View settings icon on the right side of the editor header and select the Advanced settings option. The advanced settings are: Spell Checking is used to turn on/off the spell checking option.

Alternate Input is used to turn on/off hieroglyphs. Alignment Guides is used to turn on/off alignment guides that appear when you move objects and allow you to position them on the slide precisely. Autosave is used in the online version to turn on/off automatic saving of changes you make while editing. Autorecover - is used in the desktop version to turn on/off the option that allows you to automatically recover documents if the program closes unexpectedly. Co-editing Mode is used to select a way of displaying changes made during co-editing: By default, the Fast mode is selected, the users who take part in the presentation co-editing, will see the changes in real time once they are made by other users. If you prefer not to see the changes made by other users (so that they will not disturb you, or for some other reason), select the Strict mode, and all the changes will be shown only after you click the Save icon with a notification that there are some changes made by other users. Interface theme is used to change the color scheme of the editor’s interface. Light color scheme incorporates standard orange, white, and light-gray colors with less contrast in UI elements suitable for working during daytime. Classic Light color scheme incorporates standard orange, white, and light-gray colors. Dark color scheme incorporates black, dark-gray, and light-gray colors suitable for working during nighttime. Note: Apart from the available Light, Classic Light, and Dark interface themes, ONLYOFFICE editors can now be customized with your own color theme. Please follow these instructions to learn how you can do that. Default Zoom Value is used to set the default zoom value selecting it in the list of available options from 50% to 500%. You can also choose the Fit to Slide or Fit to Width option. Font Hinting is used to select a way fonts are displayed in the Presentation Editor: Choose As Windows if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on Windows, i.e. using Windows font hinting. Choose As OS X if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on a Mac, i.e. without any font hinting at all. Choose Native if you want your text to be displayed with the hinting embedded into font files. Default cache mode - used to select the cache mode for the font characters. It’s not recommended to switch it without any reason. It can be helpful in some cases only, for example, when the Google Chrome browser has problems with the enabled hardware acceleration. The Presentation Editor has two cache modes: In the first cache mode, each letter is cached as a separate picture. In the second cache mode, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically and a mechanism of allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc. The Default cache mode setting applies two above mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers: When the Default cache mode setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the second cache mode, other browsers use the first cache mode. When the Default cache mode setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the first cache mode, other browsers use the second cache mode. Unit of Measurement is used to specify what units are used on the rulers and in properties windows for measuring elements parameters such as width, height, spacing, margins, etc. You can select the Centimeter, Point, or Inch option. Cut, copy and paste - used to show the Paste Options button when content is pasted. Check the box to enable this feature. Macros Settings - used to set macros display with a notification. Choose Disable all to disable all macros within the presentation; Show notification to receive notifications about macros within the presentation; Enable all to automatically run all macros within the presentation.

The Rotation tab contains the following parameters: Angle - use this option to rotate the shape by an exactly specified angle. Enter the necessary value measured in degrees into the field or adjust it using the arrows on the right. Flipped - check the Horizontally box to flip the shape horizontally (left to right) or check the Vertically box to flip the shape vertically (upside down). The Weights & Arrows tab contains the following parameters: Line Style - this option allows specifying the following parameters: Cap Type - this option allows setting the style for the end of the line, therefore it can be applied only to the shapes with the open outline, such as lines, polylines, etc.: Flat - the end points will be flat. Round - the end points will be rounded. Square - the end points will be square. Join Type - this option allows setting the style for the intersection of two lines, for example, it can affect a polyline or the corners of the triangle or rectangle outline: Round - the corner will be rounded. Bevel - the corner will be cut off angularly. Miter - the corner will be pointed. It goes well to shapes with sharp angles. Note: the effect will be more noticeable if you use a large outline width. Arrows - this option group is available if a shape from the Lines shape group is selected. It allows you to set the arrow Start and End Style and Size by selecting the appropriate option from the drop-down lists. The Text Padding tab allows you to change the autoshape Top, Bottom, Left and Right internal margins (i.e. the distance between the text within the shape and the autoshape borders). Note: this tab is only available if text is added within the autoshape, otherwise the tab is disabled. The Columns tab allows adding columns of text within the autoshape specifying the necessary Number of columns (up to 16) and Spacing between columns. Once you click OK, the text that already exists or any other text you enter within the autoshape will appear in columns and will flow from one column to another. The Alternative Text tab allows specifying the Title and Description which will be read to people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand the contents of the shape. To replace the added autoshape, left-click it and use the Change Autoshape drop-down list on the Shape settings tab of the right sidebar. To delete the added autoshape, left-click it and press the Delete key. To learn how to align an autoshape on the slide or arrange several autoshapes, refer to the Align and arrange objects on a slide section.

The available AutoCorrect options are listed in the corresponding dialog box. To access it, go to the File tab -> Advanced Settings -> Proofing -> AutoCorrect Options. The AutoCorrect dialog box consists of four tabs: Math Autocorrect, Recognized Functions, AutoFormat As You Type, and Text AutoCorrect. Math AutoCorrect When working with equations, you can insert a lot of symbols, accents and mathematical operation signs typing them on the keyboard instead of choosing a template from the gallery. In the equation editor, place the insertion point within the necessary placeholder, type a math autocorrect code, then press Spacebar. The entered code will be converted into the corresponding symbol, and the space will be eliminated. The codes are case sensitive. You can add, modify, restore, and remove autocorrect entries from the AutoCorrect list. Go to the File tab -> Advanced Settings -> Proofing -> AutoCorrect Options -> Math AutoCorrect. Adding an entry to the AutoCorrect list Enter the autocorrect code you want to use in the Replace box. Enter the symbol to be assigned to the code you entered in the By box. Click the Add button. Modifying an entry on the AutoCorrect list Select the entry to be modified. You can change the information in both fields: the code in the Replace box or the symbol in the By box.
