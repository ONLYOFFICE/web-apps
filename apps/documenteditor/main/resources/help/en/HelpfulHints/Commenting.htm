        <p>The <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/document-editor.aspx" target="_blank" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Document Editor</b></a> allows you to maintain a constant team-wide approach to work flow: <a href="https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/userguides/groups-guides-documents-share-documents.aspx" target="_blank" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">share</a> files and folders, <a href="../HelpfulHints/CollaborativeEditing.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">collaborate</a> on documents in real time, <a href="../HelpfulHints/Communicating.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">communicate</a> right in the editor, save <a href="../HelpfulHints/VersionHistory.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">document versions</a> for future use, <a href="../HelpfulHints/Review.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">review</a> documents and add your changes without actually editing the file, <a href="../HelpfulHints/Comparison.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">compare and merge</a> documents to facilitate processing and editing.</p>
        <p>In <b>Document Editor</b>, you can leave comments to the content of documents without actually editing it. Unlike <a href="../HelpfulHints/Communicating.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">chat</a> messages, the comments stay until deleted.</p>
        <h3>Leaving comments and replying to them</h3>
        <p>To leave a comment,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>select a text passage where you think there is an error or problem,</li>
            <li>
                switch to the <b>Insert</b> or <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar and click the <div class = "icon icon-comment_toptoolbar"></div> <b>Comment</b> button, or<br />
                use the <div class = "icon icon-commentsicon"></div> icon on the left sidebar to open the <b>Comments</b> panel, and either click the <b>Add comment</b> button in the top toolbar of the panel, or click the <b>More</b> symbol and choose the <b>Add Comment to Document</b> option to leave a comment to the whole document, or<br />
                right-click the selected text passage and select the <b>Add Сomment</b> option from the contextual menu,
            </li>
            <li>enter the required text,</li>
            <li>click the <b>Add Comment/Add</b> button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The comment will be seen on the <b>Comments</b> panel on the left. Any other user can answer the added comment, asking questions or reporting on the work they have done. For this purpose, click the <b>Add Reply</b> link situated under the comment, type in your reply in the entry field and press the <b>Reply</b> button.</p>
        <p>If you are using the <b>Strict</b> co-editing mode, new comments added by other users will become visible only after you click the <span class = "icon icon-saveupdate"></span> icon in the left upper corner of the top toolbar.</p>
        <h3>Disabling display of comments</h3>
        <p>The text passage you commented will be highlighted in the document. To view the comment, just click within the passage. To disable this feature,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>click the <b>File</b> tab at the top toolbar,</li>
            <li>select the <b>Advanced Settings</b> option,</li>
            <li>uncheck the <b>Turn on display of the comments</b> box.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now the commented passages will be highlighted only if you click the <span class = "icon icon-commentsicon"></span> icon.</p>
        <h3>Managing comments</h3>
        <p>You can manage the added comments using the icons in the comment balloon or on the <b>Comments</b> panel on the left:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                sort the added comments by clicking the <div class = "icon icon-sortcommentsicon"></div> icon:
                <ul>
                    <li>by date: <b>Newest</b> or <b>Oldest</b>. This is the sort order by default.</li>
                    <li>by author: <b>Author from A to Z</b> or <b>Author from Z to A</b>.</li>
                    <li>by location: <b>From top</b> or <b>From bottom</b>. The usual sort order of comments by their location in a document is as follows (from top): <em>comments to text</em>, <em>comments to footnotes</em>, <em>comments to endnotes</em>, <em>comments to headers/footers</em>, <em>comments to the entire document</em>.</li>
                    <li>by group: <b>All</b> or choose a certain group from the list. This sorting option is available if you are running a version that includes this functionality.

                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>edit the currently selected comment by clicking the <div class = "icon icon-editcommenticon"></div> icon,</li>
            <li>delete the currently selected comment by clicking the <div class = "icon icon-deletecommenticon"></div> icon,</li>
            <li>close the currently selected discussion by clicking the <div class = "icon icon-resolveicon"></div> icon if the task or problem you stated in your comment was solved, after that the discussion you opened with your comment gets the resolved status. To open it again, click the <div class = "icon icon-resolvedicon"></div> icon. If you want to hide resolved comments, click the <b>File</b> tab on the top toolbar, select the <b>Advanced Settings</b> option, uncheck the <b>Turn on display of the resolved comments</b> box and click <b>Apply</b>. In this case, the resolved comments will be highlighted only if you click the <div class = "icon icon-commentsicon"></div> icon,</li>
            <li>if you want to manage comments in a bunch, open the <b>Resolve</b> drop-down menu on the <b>Collaboration</b> tab. Select one of the options for resolving comments: <b>resolve current comments</b>, <b>resolve my comments</b> or <b>resolve all comments</b> in the document.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Adding mentions</h3>
        <p class="note">You can only add mentions to the comments made to the text parts and not to the document itself.</p>
        <p>When entering comments, you can use the <b>mentions</b> feature that allows you to attract somebody's attention to the comment and send a notification to the mentioned user via email and <b>Talk</b>.</p>
        <p>To add a mention,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the "+" or "@" sign anywhere in the comment text - a list of the portal users will open. To simplify the search process, you can start typing a name in the comment field - the user list will change as you type.</li>
            <li>Select the necessary person from the list. If the file has not yet been shared with the mentioned user, the <b>Sharing Settings</b> window will open. <b>Read only</b> access type is selected by default. <a href="https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/userguides/groups-guides-documents-share-documents.aspx" target="_blank" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">Change it if necessary</a>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The mentioned user will receive an email notification that they have been mentioned in a comment. If the file has been shared, the user will also receive a corresponding notification.</p>
        <h3>Removing comments</h3>
        <p>To remove comments,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>click the <div class = "icon icon-removecomment_toptoolbar"></div> <b>Remove</b> button on the <b>Collaboration</b> tab of the top toolbar,</li>
            <li>
                select the necessary option from the menu:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Remove Current Comments</b> - to remove the currently selected comment. If some replies have been added to the comment, all its replies will be removed as well.</li>
                    <li><b>Remove My Comments</b> - to remove comments you added, without removing comments added by other users. If some replies have been added to your comment, all its replies will be removed as well.</li>
                    <li><b>Remove All Comments</b> - to remove all the comments in the document that you and other users added.</li>
                </ul>
