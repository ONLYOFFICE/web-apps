				<ul>
				    <li><p><div class = "icon icon-wrappingstyle_inline"></div> <b>Inline</b> - the image is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the image moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible.</p>
				    <p>If one of the following styles is selected, the image can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly:</p>
				    </li>

				    </ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom style, you will be able to set up some additional parameters - <b>distance from text</b> at all sides (top, bottom, left, right).</p>
            <p id="position"><img alt="Image - Advanced Settings: Position" src="../images/image_properties_2.png" /></p>
