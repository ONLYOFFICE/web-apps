Additional info on the comparison feature Method of comparison Documents are compared by words. If a word contains a change of at least one character (e.g. if a character was removed or replaced), in the result, the difference will be displayed as the change of the entire word, not the character. The image below illustrates the case when the original file contains the word 'Characters' and the document for comparison contains the word 'Character'. Authorship of the document When the comparison process is launched, the second document for comparison is being loaded and compared to the current one. If the loaded document contains some data which is not represented in the original document, the data will be marked as added by a reviewer. If the original document contains some data which is not represented in the loaded document, the data will be marked as deleted by a reviewer. If the authors of the original and loaded documents are the same person, the reviewer is the same user. His/her name is displayed in the change balloon. If the authors of two files are different users, then the author of the second file loaded for comparison is the author of the added/removed changes. Presence of the tracked changes in the compared document If the original document contains some changes made in the review mode, they will be accepted in the comparison process. When you choose the second file for comparison, you'll see the corresponding warning message. In this case, when you choose the Original display mode, the document will not contain any changes."

To do that, Select the text you want to include into the table of contents. Open the style menu on the right side of the Home tab at the top toolbar. Click the required style to be applied.

Highlight color Used to mark separate sentences, phrases, words, or even characters by adding a color band that imitates the highlighter pen effect throughout the text. You can select the required part of the text and click the downward arrow next to the icon to select a color in the palette (this color set does not depend on the selected Color scheme and includes 16 colors) - the color will be applied to the selected text. Alternatively, you can first choose a highlight color and then start selecting the text with the mouse - the mouse pointer will look like this and you'll be able to highlight several different parts of your text sequentially. To stop highlighting, just click the icon once again. To delete the highlight color, choose the No Fill option. The Highlight color is different from the Background color as the latter is applied to the whole paragraph and completely fills all the paragraph space from the left page margin to the right page margin. Font color Used to change the color of the letters/characters in the text. By default, the automatic font color is set in a new blank document. It is displayed as a black font on the white background. If you change the background color to black, the font color will automatically change to white to keep the text clearly visible. To choose a different color, click the downward arrow next to the icon and select a color from the available palettes (the colors in the Theme Colors palette depend on the selected color scheme). After you change the default font color, you can use the Automatic option in the color palettes window to quickly restore the automatic color for the selected text passage.

        "title": "Apply formatting styles", 
        "body": "Each formatting style is a set of predefined formatting options: (font size, color, line spacing, alignment etc.). The styles in the Document Editor allow you to quickly format different parts of the document (headings, subheadings, lists, normal text, quotes) instead of applying several formatting options individually each time. This also ensures the consistent appearance of the whole document. You can also use styles to create a table of contents or a table of figures. Applying a style depends on whether this style is a paragraph style (normal, no spacing, headings, list paragraph etc.), or a text style (based on the font type, size, color). It also depends on whether a text passage is selected, or the mouse cursor is placed on a word. In some cases you might need to select the required style from the style library twice, so that it can be applied correctly: when you click the style in the style panel for the first time, the paragraph style properties are applied. When you click it for the second time, the text properties are applied. Use default styles To apply one of the available text formatting styles, place the cursor within the required paragraph, or select several paragraphs, select the required style from the style gallery on the right on the Home tab of the top toolbar. The following formatting styles are available: normal, no spacing, heading 1-9, title, subtitle, quote, intense quote, list paragraph, footer, header, footnote text. Edit existing styles and create new ones To change an existing style: Apply the necessary style to a paragraph. Select the paragraph text and change all the formatting parameters you need. Save the changes made: right-click the edited text, select the Formatting as Style option and then choose the Update 'StyleName' Style option ('StyleName' corresponds to the style you've applied at the step 1), or select the edited text passage with the mouse, drop-down the style gallery, right-click the style you want to change and select the Update from selection option. Once the style is modified, all the paragraphs in the document formatted with this style will change their appearance correspondingly. To create a completely new style: Format a text passage as you need. Select an appropriate way to save the style: right-click the edited text, select the Formatting as Style option and then choose the Create new Style option, or select the edited text passage with the mouse, drop-down the style gallery and click the New style from selection option. Set the new style parameters in the opened Create New Style window: Specify the new style name in the text entry field. Select the desired style for the subsequent paragraph from the Next paragraph style list. It's also possible to choose the Same as created new style option. Click the OK button. The created style will be added to the style gallery. Manage your custom styles: To restore the default settings of a certain style you've changed, right-click the style you want to restore and select the Restore to default option. To restore the default settings of all the styles you've changed, right-click any default style in the style gallery and select the Restore all to default styles option. To delete one of the new styles you've created, right-click the style you want to delete and select the Delete style option.

Note: to add a caption to an autoshape, make sure the required shape is selected on the page and start typing your text. The added text becomes a part of the autoshape (when you move or rotate the shape, the text moves or rotates with it). It's also possible to add a caption to the autoshape. To learn more on how to work with captions for autoshapes, you can refer to this article. Move and resize autoshapes To change the autoshape size, drag small squares situated on the shape edges. To maintain the original proportions of the selected autoshape while resizing, hold down the Shift key and drag one of the corner icons. When modifying some shapes, for example figured arrows or callouts, the yellow diamond-shaped icon is also available. It allows you to adjust some aspects of the shape, for example, the length of the head of an arrow. To alter the autoshape position, use the icon that appears after hovering your mouse cursor over the autoshape. Drag the autoshape to the required position without releasing the mouse button. When you move the autoshape, the guide lines are displayed to help you precisely position the object on the page (if the selected wrapping style is not inline). To move the autoshape by one-pixel increments, hold down the Ctrl key and use the keybord arrows. To move the autoshape strictly horizontally/vertically and prevent it from moving in a perpendicular direction, hold down the Shift key when dragging. To rotate the autoshape, hover the mouse cursor over the rotation handle and drag it clockwise or counterclockwise. To constrain the rotation angle to 15 degree increments, hold down the Shift key while rotating. Note: the list of keyboard shortcuts that can be used when working with objects is available here. Adjust autoshape settings To align and arrange autoshapes, use the right-click menu. The menu options are: Cut, Copy, Paste - standard options which are used to cut or copy the selected text/object and paste the previously cut/copied text passage or object to the current cursor position. Arrange is used to bring the selected autoshape to foreground, send it to background, move forward or backward as well as group or ungroup shapes to perform operations with several of them at once. To learn more on how to arrange objects, please refer to this page. Align is used to align the shape to the left, in the center, to the right, at the top, in the middle, at the bottom. To learn more on how to align objects, please refer to this page. Wrapping Style is used to select a text wrapping style from the available ones - inline, square, tight, through, top and bottom, in front, behind - or edit the wrap boundary. The Edit Wrap Boundary option is available only if you select a wrapping style other than Inline. Drag wrap points to customize the boundary. To create a new wrap point, click anywhere on the red line and drag it to the necessary position. Rotate is used to rotate the shape by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise as well as to flip the shape horizontally or vertically.

You can choose the following options: Color Fill - select this option to specify the solid color to fill the inner space of the selected autoshape. Click the colored box below and select the necessary color from the available color sets or specify any color you like: Gradient Fill - use this option to fill the shape with two or more fading colors. Customize your gradient fill with no constraints. Click the Shape settings icon to open the Fill menu on the right sidebar: Available menu options: Style - choose between Linear or Radial: Linear is used  when you need your colors to flow from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, or at any angle you chose in a single direction. Click Direction to choose a preset direction and click Angle for a precise gradient angle. Radial is used to move from the center as it starts at a single point and emanates outward. Gradient Point is a specific point for transition from one color to another. Use the Add Gradient Point button or slider bar to add a gradient point. You can add up to 10 gradient points. Each next gradient point added will in no way affect the current gradient fill appearance. Use the Remove Gradient Point button to delete a certain gradient point. Use the slider bar to change the location of the gradient point or specify Position in percentage for precise location. To apply a color to a gradient point, click a point on the slider bar, and then click Color to choose the color you want. Picture or Texture - select this option to use an image or a predefined texture as the shape background. If you wish to use an image as a background for the shape, you can add an image From File by selecting it on your computer hard disc drive, From URL by inserting the appropriate URL address into the opened window, or From Storage by selecting the required image stored on your portal. If you wish to use a texture as a background for the shape, open the From Texture menu and select the necessary texture preset. Currently, the following textures are available: canvas, carton, dark fabric, grain, granite, grey paper, knit, leather, brown paper, papyrus, wood. In case the selected Picture has less or more dimensions than the autoshape has, you can choose the Stretch or Tile setting from the dropdown list. The Stretch option allows you to adjust the image size to fit the autoshape size so that it could fill the space completely. The Tile option allows you to display only a part of the bigger image keeping its original dimensions or repeat the smaller image keeping its original dimensions over the autoshape surface so that it could fill the space completely. Note: any selected Texture preset fills the space completely, but you can apply the Stretch effect if necessary. Pattern - select this option to fill the shape with a two-colored design composed of regularly repeated elements. Pattern - select one of the predefined designs from the menu. Foreground color - click this color box to change the color of the pattern elements. Background color - click this color box to change the color of the pattern background. No Fill - select this option if you don't want to use any fill. Opacity - use this section to set an Opacity level dragging the slider or entering the percent value manually. The default value is 100%. It corresponds to the full opacity. The 0% value corresponds to the full transparency. Line - use this section to change the width, color or type of the autoshape line. To change the line width, select one of the available options from the Size dropdown list. The available options are: 0.5 pt, 1 pt, 1.5 pt, 2.25 pt, 3 pt, 4.5 pt, 6 pt. Alternatively, select the No Line option if you don't want to use any line. To change the line color, click on the colored box below and select the necessary color. To change the line type, select the necessary option from the corresponding dropdown list (a solid line is applied by default, you can change it to one of the available dashed lines). Rotation is used to rotate the shape by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise as well as to flip the shape horizontally or vertically. Click one of the buttons: to rotate the shape by 90 degrees counterclockwise to rotate the shape by 90 degrees clockwise to flip the shape horizontally (left to right) to flip the shape vertically (upside down) Wrapping Style - use this section to select a text wrapping style from the available ones - inline, square, tight, through, top and bottom, in front, behind (for more information see the advanced settings description below). Change Autoshape - use this section to replace the current autoshape with another one selected from the dropdown list. Show shadow - check this option to display the shape with a shadow. Adjust autoshape advanced settings To change the advanced settings of the autoshape, right-click it and select the Advanced Settings option in the menu or use the Show advanced settings link on the right sidebar. The 'Shape - Advanced Settings' window will open: The Size tab contains the following parameters: Width - use one of these options to change the autoshape width. Absolute - specify an exact value measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab). Relative - specify a percentage relative to the left margin width, the margin (i.e. the distance between the left and right margins), the page width, or the right margin width. Height - use one of these options to change the autoshape height. Absolute - specify an exact value measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab). Relative - specify a percentage relative to the margin (i.e. the distance between the top and bottom margins), the bottom margin height, the page height, or the top margin height. If the Lock aspect ratio option is checked, the width and height will be changed together preserving the original shape aspect ratio. The Rotation tab contains the following parameters: Angle - use this option to rotate the shape by an exactly specified angle. Enter the necessary value measured in degrees into the field or adjust it using the arrows on the right. Flipped - check the Horizontally box to flip the shape horizontally (left to right) or check the Vertically box to flip the shape vertically (upside down). The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Wrapping Style - use this option to change the way the shape is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles). Inline - the shape is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the shape moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible. If one of the following styles is selected, the shape can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly: Square - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the shape. Tight - the text wraps the actual shape edges. Through - the text wraps around the shape edges and fills in the open white space within the shape. So that the effect can appear, use the Edit Wrap Boundary option from the right-click menu. Top and bottom - the text is only above and below the shape. In front - the shape overlaps the text. Behind - the text overlaps the shape. If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom styles, you will be able to set up some additional parameters - distance from text at all sides (top, bottom, left, right). The Position tab is available only if the selected wrapping style is not inline. This tab contains the following parameters that vary depending on the selected wrapping style: The Horizontal section allows you to select one of the following three autoshape positioning types: Alignment (left, center, right) relative to character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) to the right of character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the left margin, margin, page or right margin. The Vertical section allows you to select one of the following three autoshape positioning types: Alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) below line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the margin, bottom margin, page or top margin. Move object with text ensures that the autoshape moves along with the text to which it is anchored. Allow overlap makes it possible for two autoshapes to overlap if you drag them near each other on the page. The Weights &amp; Arrows tab contains the following parameters: Line Style - this option group allows specifying the following parameters: Cap Type - this option allows setting the style for the end of the line, therefore it can be applied only to the shapes with the open outline, such as lines, polylines etc.: Flat - the end points will be flat. Round - the end points will be rounded. Square - the end points will be square. Join Type - this option allows setting the style for the intersection of two lines, for example, it can affect a polyline or the corners of the triangle or rectangle outline: Round - the corner will be rounded. Bevel - the corner will be cut off angularly. Miter - the corner will be pointed. It goes well to shapes with sharp angles. Note: the effect will be more noticeable if you use a large outline width. Arrows - this option group is available if a shape from the Lines shape group is selected. It allows setting the arrow Start and End Style and Size by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown lists. The Text Padding tab allows changing the Top, Bottom, Left and Right internal margins of the autoshape (i.e. the distance between the text within the shape and the autoshape borders). Note: this tab is only available if text is added within the autoshape, otherwise the tab is disabled. The Alternative Text tab allows specifying a Title and Description which will be read to people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information the shape contains."

Maximum Value - is used to specify the highest value displayed at the vertical axis end. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the maximum value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Fixed option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right. Axis Crosses - is used to specify a point on the vertical axis where the horizontal axis should cross it. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the axes intersection point value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Value option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right, or set the axes intersection point at the Minimum/Maximum Value on the vertical axis. Display Units - is used to determine the representation of the numeric values along the vertical axis. This option can be useful if you're working with great numbers and wish the values on the axis to be displayed in a more compact and readable way (e.g. you can represent 50 000 as 50 by using the Thousands display units). Select desired units from the drop-down list: Hundreds, Thousands, 10 000, 100 000, Millions, 10 000 000, 100 000 000, Billions, Trillions, or choose the None option to return to the default units.

Axis Position - is used to specify where the axis text labels should be placed: On Tick Marks or Between Tick Marks. Values in reverse order - is used to display categories in the opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, categories are displayed from left to right. When the box is checked, the categories are ordered from right to left. The Tick Options section allows adjusting the appearance of tick marks on the horizontal scale. Major tick marks are the larger divisions which can have labels displaying category values. Minor tick marks are the smaller divisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels. Tick marks also define where gridlines can be displayed if the corresponding option is set on the Layout tab. You can adjust the following tick mark parameters: Major/Minor Type - is used to specify the following placement options: None to not display major/minor tick marks, Cross to display major/minor tick marks on both sides of the axis, In to display major/minor tick marks inside the axis, Out to display major/minor tick marks outside the axis. Interval between Marks - is used to specify how many categories should be displayed between two adjacent tick marks. The Label Options section allows adjusting the appearance of labels which display categories. Label Position - is used to specify where the labels should be placed in regard to the horizontal axis. Select the necessary option from the drop-down list: None to not display category labels, Low to display category labels at the bottom of the plot area, High to display category labels at the top of the plot area, Next to axis to display category labels next to the axis. Axis Label Distance - is used to specify how closely the labels should be placed to the axis. You can specify the necessary value in the entry field. The more the value you set, the more the distance between the axis and labels is. Interval between Labels - is used to specify how often the labels should be displayed. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case labels are displayed for every category. You can select the Manual option from the drop-down list and specify the necessary value in the entry field on the right.

If the Constant Proportions button is clicked (in this case it looks like this ), the width and height will be changed together preserving the original chart aspect ratio. The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Wrapping Style - use this option to change the way the chart is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles). Inline - the chart is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the chart moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible. If one of the following styles is selected, the chart can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly: Square - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the chart. Tight - the text wraps the actual chart edges. Through - the text wraps around the chart edges and fills in the open white space within the chart. Top and bottom - the text is only above and below the chart. In front - the chart overlaps the text. Behind - the text overlaps the chart. If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom styles, you will be able to set up some additional parameters - distance from text at all sides (top, bottom, left, right). The Position tab is available only if the selected wrapping style is not inline. This tab contains the following parameters that vary depending on the selected wrapping style: The Horizontal section allows you to select one of the following three chart positioning types: Alignment (left, center, right) relative to character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) to the right of character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the left margin, margin, page or right margin. The Vertical section allows you to select one of the following three chart positioning types: Alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) below line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the margin, bottom margin, page or top margin. Move object with text ensures that the chart moves along with the text to which it is anchored. Allow overlap makes it possible for two charts to overlap if you drag them near each other on the page. The Alternative Text tab allows specifying a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information the chart contains."

To align such an equation to the left or to the right, click on the equation box and use the or icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar. Each equation template represents a set of slots. A slot is a position for each element that makes up the equation. An empty slot (also called as a placeholder) has a dotted outline . You need to fill in all the placeholders specifying the necessary values. Note: to start creating an equation, you can also use the Alt + = keyboard shortcut. It's also possible to add a caption to the equation. To learn more on how to work with captions for equations, please refer to this article. Enter values The insertion point specifies where the next character will appear. To position the insertion point precisely, click within the placeholder and use the keyboard arrows to move the insertion point by one character left/right or one line up/down. If you need to create a new placeholder below the slot with the insertion point within the selected template, press Enter. Once the insertion point is positioned, you can fill in the placeholder: enter the desired numeric/literal value using the keyboard, insert a special character using the Symbols palette from the Equation menu on the Insert tab of the top toolbar or typing them from the keyboard (see the Math AutoСorrect option description), add another equation template from the palette to create a complex nested equation. The size of the primary equation will be automatically adjusted to fit its content. The size of the nested equation elements depends on the primary equation placeholder size, but it cannot be smaller than the sub-subscript size. To add some new equation elements you can also use the right-click menu options: To add a new argument that goes before or after the existing one within Brackets, you can right-click on the existing argument and select the Insert argument before/after option from the menu. To add a new equation within Cases with several conditions from the Brackets group (or equations of other types, if you've previously added new placeholders by pressing Enter), you can right-click on an empty placeholder or entered equation within it and select the Insert equation before/after option from the menu. To add a new row or a column in a Matrix, you can right-click on a placeholder within it, select the Insert option from the menu, then select Row Above/Below or Column Left/Right. Note: currently, equations cannot be entered using the linear format, i.e. \\sqrt(4&x^3). When entering the values of the mathematical expressions, you do not need to use Spacebar as the spaces between the characters and signs of operations are set automatically. If the equation is too long and does not fit a single line, automatic line breaking occurs while typing. You can also insert a line break in a specific position by right-clicking on a mathematical operator and selecting the Insert manual break option from the menu. The selected operator will start a new line. Once the manual line break is added, you can press the Tab key to align the new line to any math operator of the previous line.

Distribute rows is used to adjust the selected cells so that they have the same height without changing the overall table height. Distribute columns is used to adjust the selected cells so that they have the same width without changing the overall table width. Cell Vertical Alignment is used to align the text top, center or bottom in the selected cell. Text Direction - is used to change the text orientation in a cell. You can place the text horizontally, vertically from top to bottom (Rotate Text Down), or vertically from bottom to top (Rotate Text Up). Table Advanced Settings is used to open the 'Table - Advanced Settings' window. Hyperlink is used to insert a hyperlink. Paragraph Advanced Settings is used to open the 'Paragraph - Advanced Settings' window. You can also change the table properties on the right sidebar: Rows and Columns are used to select the table parts that you want to be highlighted. For rows: Header - to highlight the first row Total - to highlight the last row Banded - to highlight every other row For columns: First - to highlight the first column Last - to highlight the last column Banded - to highlight every other column Select from Template is used to choose a table template from the available ones. Borders Style is used to select the border size, color, style as well as background color. Rows &amp; Columns is used to perform some operations with the table: select, delete, insert rows and columns, merge cells, split a cell. Rows &amp; Columns Size is used to adjust the width and height of the currently selected cell. In this section, you can also Distribute rows so that all the selected cells have equal height or Distribute columns so that all the selected cells have equal width. Add formula is used to insert a formula into the selected table cell. Repeat as header row at the top of each page is used to insert the same header row at the top of each page in long tables. Convert Table to Text is used to arrange the table in a plain text form. The Convert Table to Text window sets the delimiter type for the conversion: Paragraph marks, Tabs, Semicolons, and Other (enter the preferred delimiter manually).

Adjust table advanced settings To change the advanced table properties, click the table with the right mouse button and select the Table Advanced Settings option from the right-click menu or use the Show advanced settings link on the right sidebar. The table properties window will open: The Table tab allows changing the properties of the entire table. The Table Size section contains the following parameters: Width - by default, the table width is automatically adjusted to fit the page width, i.e. the table occupies all the space between the left and right page margin. You can check this box and specify the necessary table width manually. Measure in allows specifying the table width in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) or in Percent of the overall page width. Note: you can also adjust the table size manually changing the row height and column width. Move the mouse cursor over a row/column border until it turns into the bidirectional arrow and drag the border. You can also use the markers on the horizontal ruler to change the column width and the markers on the vertical ruler to change the row height. Automatically resize to fit contents - allows automatically change the width of each column in accordance with the text within its cells. The Default Cell Margins section allows changing the space between the text within the cells and the cell border used by default. The Options section allows changing the following parameter: Spacing between cells - the cell spacing which will be filled with the Table Background color. The Cell tab allows changing the properties of individual cells. First you need to select the required cell or select the entire table to change the properties of all its cells. The Cell Size section contains the following parameters: Preferred width - allows setting the preferred cell width. This is the size that a cell strives to fit, but in some cases, it may not be possible to fit this exact value. For example, if the text within a cell exceeds the specified width, it will be broken into the next line so that the preferred cell width remains unchanged, but if you insert a new column, the preferred width will be reduced. Measure in - allows specifying the cell width in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified on the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) or in Percent of the overall table width. Note: you can also adjust the cell width manually. To make a single cell in a column wider or narrower than the overall column width, select the necessary cell and move the mouse cursor over its right border until it turns into the bidirectional arrow, then drag the border. To change the width of all the cells in a column, use the markers on the horizontal ruler to change the column width. The Cell Margins allows adjusting the space between the text within the cells and the cell border. By default, the standard values are used (the default, these values can also be altered on the Table tab), but you can uncheck the Use default margins box and enter the necessary values manually. The Cell Options section allows changing the following parameter: The Wrap text option is enabled by default. It allows wrapping the text within a cell that exceeds its width onto the next line expanding the row height and keeping the column width unchanged. The Borders &amp; Background tab contains the following parameters: Border parameters (size, color and presence or absence) - set the border size, select its color and choose the way it will be displayed in the cells. Note: in case you choose not to show the table borders by clicking the button or deselecting all the borders manually on the diagram, they will be indicated with a dotted line in the document. To make them disappear at all, click the Nonprinting characters icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar and select the Hidden Table Borders option. Cell Background - the color for the background within the cells (available only if one or more cells are selected or the Allow spacing between cells option is selected at the Table tab). Table Background - the color for the table background or the space background between the cells in case the Allow spacing between cells option is selected on the Table tab. The Table Position tab is available only if the Flow table option on the Text Wrapping tab is selected and contains the following parameters: Horizontal parameters include the table alignment (left, center, right) relative to margin, page or text as well as the table position to the right of margin, page or text. Vertical parameters include the table alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to margin, page or text as well as the table position below margin, page or text. The Options section allows changing the following parameters: Move object with text ensures that the table moves with the text. Allow overlap controls whether two tables are merged into one large table or overlap if you drag them near each other on the page. The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Text wrapping style - Inline table or Flow table. Use the necessary option to change the way the table is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline table) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select the flow table). After you select the wrapping style, the additional wrapping parameters can be set both for inline and flow tables: For the inline table, you can specify the table alignment and indent from left. For the flow table, you can specify the distance from text and table position on the Table Position tab. The Alternative Text tab allows specifying the Title and Description which will be read to people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand the contents of the table."

        "body": "A drop cap is a large capital letter used at the beginning of a paragraph or section. The size of a drop cap is usually several lines. To add a drop cap in the Document Editor, place the cursor within the required paragraph, switch to the Insert tab of the top toolbar, click the Drop Cap icon on the top toolbar, in the opened drop-down list select the option you need: In Text - to place the drop cap within the paragraph. In Margin - to place the drop cap in the left margin. The first character of the selected paragraph will be transformed into a drop cap. If you need the drop cap to include some more characters, add them manually: select the drop cap and type in other letters you need. To adjust the drop cap appearance (i.e. font size, type, decoration style or color), select the letter and use the corresponding icons on the Home tab of the top toolbar. When the drop cap is selected, it's surrounded by a frame (a container used to position the drop cap on the page). You can quickly change the frame size dragging its borders or change its position using the icon that appears after hovering your mouse cursor over the frame. To delete the added drop cap, select it, click the Drop Cap icon on the Insert tab of the top toolbar and choose the None option from the drop-down list. To adjust the added drop cap parameters, select it, click the Drop Cap icon at the Insert tab of the top toolbar and choose the Drop Cap Settings option from the drop-down list. The Drop Cap - Advanced Settings window will appear: The Drop Cap tab allows adjusting the following parameters: Position is used to change the placement of a drop cap. Select the In Text or In Margin option, or click None to delete the drop cap. Font is used to select a font from the list of the available fonts. Height in rows is used to define how many lines a drop cap should span. It's possible to select a value from 1 to 10. Distance from text is used to specify the amount of spacing between the text of the paragraph and the right border of the drop cap frame. The Borders &amp; Fill tab allows adding a border around a drop cap and adjusting its parameters. They are the following: Border parameters (size, color and presence or absence) - set the border size, select its color and choose the borders (top, bottom, left, right or their combination) you want to apply these settings to. Background color - choose the color for the drop cap background. The Margins tab allows setting the distance between the drop cap and the Top, Bottom, Left and Right borders around it (if the borders have previously been added). Once the drop cap is added you can also change the Frame parameters. To access them, right click within the frame and select the Frame Advanced Settings from the menu. The Frame - Advanced Settings window will open: The Frame tab allows adjusting the following parameters: Position is used to select the Inline or Flow wrapping style. You can also click None to delete the frame. Width and Height are used to change the frame dimensions. The Auto option allows automatically adjusting the frame size to fit the drop cap. The Exactly option allows specifying fixed values. The At least option is used to set the minimum height value (if you change the drop cap size, the frame height changes accordingly, but it cannot be less than the specified value). Horizontal parameters are used either to set the exact position of the frame in the selected units of measurement with respect to a margin, page or column, or to align the frame (left, center or right) with respect to one of these reference points. You can also set the horizontal Distance from text i.e. the amount of space between the vertical frame borders and the text of the paragraph. Vertical parameters are used either to set the exact position of the frame is the selected units of measurement with respect to a margin, page or paragraph, or to align the frame (top, center or bottom) with respect to one of these reference points. You can also set the vertical Distance from text i.e. the amount of space between the horizontal frame borders and the text of the paragraph. Move with text is used to make sure that the frame moves as the paragraph to which it is anchored. The Borders &amp; Fill and Margins allow adjusting the same parameters as the corresponding tabs in the Drop Cap - Advanced Settings window."
