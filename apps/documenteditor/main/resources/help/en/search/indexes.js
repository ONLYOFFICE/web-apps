The table of contents is generated automatically on the base of the document headings formatted using built-in styles. This makes it easy to update the created table of contents without the necessity to edit headings and change page numbers manually if the document text has been changed. Define the heading structure Format headings First of all, format headings in you document using one of the predefined styles. To do that, Select the text you want to include into the table of contents. Open the style menu on the right side of the Home tab at the top toolbar. Click the style you want to apply. By default, you can use the Heading 1 - Heading 9 styles. Note: if you want to use other styles (e.g. Title, Subtitle etc.) to format headings that will be included into the table of contents, you will need to adjust the table of contents settings first (see the corresponding section below). To learn more about available formatting styles, you can refer to this page. Manage headings Once the headings are formatted, you can click the Navigation icon at the left sidebar to open the panel that displays the list of all headings with corresponding nesting levels. This panel allows to easily navigate between headings in the document text as well as manage the heading structure. Right-click on a heading in the list and use one of the available options from the menu: Promote - to move the currently selected heading up to the higher level in the hierarchical structure, e.g. change it from Heading 2 to Heading 1.

New heading before - to add a new empty heading of the same level before the currently selected one. New heading after - to add a new empty heading of the same level after the currently selected one. New subheading - to add a new empty subheading (i.e. a heading with lower level) after the currently selected heading. When the heading or subheading is added, click on the added empty heading in the list and type in your own text. This can be done both in the document text and on the Navigation panel itself. Select content - to select the text below the current heading in the document (including the text related to all subheadings of this heading). Expand all - to expand all levels of headings at the Navigation panel. Collapse all - to collapse all levels of headings, excepting level 1, at the Navigation panel. Expand to level - to expand the heading structure to the selected level. E.g. if you select level 3, then levels 1, 2 and 3 will be expanded, while level 4 and all lower levels will be collapsed. To manually expand or collapse separate heading levels, use the arrows to the left of the headings. To close the Navigation panel, click the Navigation icon at the left sidebar once again.

Note: to add a caption within the autoshape make sure the shape is selected on the page and start typing your text. The text you add in this way becomes a part of the autoshape (when you move or rotate the shape, the text moves or rotates with it). Move and resize autoshapes To change the autoshape size, drag small squares situated on the shape edges. To maintain the original proportions of the selected autoshape while resizing, hold down the Shift key and drag one of the corner icons.</pid> When modifying some shapes, for example figured arrows or callouts, the yellow diamond-shaped icon is also available. It allows you to adjust some aspects of the shape, for example, the length of the head of an arrow. To alter the autoshape position, use the icon that appears after hovering your mouse cursor over the autoshape. Drag the autoshape to the necessary position without releasing the mouse button. When you move the autoshape, guide lines are displayed to help you position the object on the page precisely (if a wrapping style other than inline is selected). To move the autoshape by one-pixel increments, hold down the Ctrl key and use the keybord arrows. To move the autoshape strictly horizontally/vertically and prevent it from moving in a perpendicular direction, hold down the Shift key when dragging. To rotate the autoshape, hover the mouse cursor over the rotation handle and drag it clockwise or counterclockwise. To constrain the rotation angle to 15 degree increments, hold down the Shift key while rotating. Adjust autoshape settings To align and arrange autoshapes, use the right-click menu. The menu options are: Cut, Copy, Paste - standard options which are used to cut or copy a selected text/object and paste a previously cut/copied text passage or object to the current cursor position. Arrange is used to bring the selected autoshape to foreground, send to background, move forward or backward as well as group or ungroup shapes to perform operations with several of them at once. To learn more on how to arrange objects you can refer to this page. Align is used to align the shape left, center, right, top, middle, bottom. To learn more on how to align objects you can refer to this page. Wrapping Style is used to select a text wrapping style from the available ones - inline, square, tight, through, top and bottom, in front, behind - or edit the wrap boundary. The Edit Wrap Boundary option is available only if you select a wrapping style other than Inline. Drag wrap points to customize the boundary. To create a new wrap point, click anywhere on the red line and drag it to the necessary position. Shape Advanced Settings is used to open the 'Shape - Advanced Settings' window. Some of the autoshape settings can be altered using the Shape settings tab of the right sidebar. To activate it click the shape and choose the Shape settings icon on the right. Here you can change the following properties: Fill - use this section to select the autoshape fill. You can choose the following options: Color Fill - select this option to specify the solid color you want to fill the inner space of the selected autoshape with. Click the colored box below and select the necessary color from the available color sets or specify any color you like: Gradient Fill - select this option to fill the shape with two colors which smoothly change from one to another. Style - choose one of the available options: Linear (colors change in a straight line i.e. along a horizontal/vertical axis or diagonally at a 45 degree angle) or Radial (colors change in a circular path from the center to the edges). Direction - choose a template from the menu. If the Linear gradient is selected, the following directions are available: top-left to bottom-right, top to bottom, top-right to bottom-left, right to left, bottom-right to top-left, bottom to top, bottom-left to top-right, left to right. If the Radial gradient is selected, only one template is available. Gradient - click on the left slider under the gradient bar to activate the color box which corresponds to the first color. Click on the color box on the right to choose the first color in the palette. Drag the slider to set the gradient stop i.e. the point where one color changes into another. Use the right slider under the gradient bar to specify the second color and set the gradient stop. Picture or Texture - select this option to use an image or a predefined texture as the shape background. If you wish to use an image as a background for the shape, you can add an image From File selecting it on your computer HDD or From URL inserting the appropriate URL address into the opened window. If you wish to use a texture as a background for the shape, open the From Texture menu and select the necessary texture preset. Currently, the following textures are available: canvas, carton, dark fabric, grain, granite, grey paper, knit, leather, brown paper, papyrus, wood. In case the selected Picture has less or more dimensions than the autoshape has, you can choose the Stretch or Tile setting from the dropdown list. The Stretch option allows you to adjust the image size to fit the autoshape size so that it could fill the space completely. The Tile option allows you to display only a part of the bigger image keeping its original dimensions or repeat the smaller image keeping its original dimensions over the autoshape surface so that it could fill the space completely. Note: any selected Texture preset fills the space completely, but you can apply the Stretch effect if necessary. Pattern - select this option to fill the shape with a two-colored design composed of regularly repeated elements. Pattern - select one of the predefined designs from the menu. Foreground color - click this color box to change the color of the pattern elements. Background color - click this color box to change the color of the pattern background. No Fill - select this option if you don't want to use any fill. Opacity - use this section to set an Opacity level dragging the slider or entering the percent value manually. The default value is 100%. It corresponds to the full opacity. The 0% value corresponds to the full transparency. Stroke - use this section to change the autoshape stroke width, color or type. To change the stroke width, select one of the available options from the Size dropdown list. The available options are: 0.5 pt, 1 pt, 1.5 pt, 2.25 pt, 3 pt, 4.5 pt, 6 pt. Alternatively, select the No Line option if you don't want to use any stroke. To change the stroke color, click on the colored box below and select the necessary color.

Wrapping Style - use this section to select a text wrapping style from the available ones - inline, square, tight, through, top and bottom, in front, behind (for more information see the advanced settings description below). Change Autoshape - use this section to replace the current autoshape with another one selected from the dropdown list. To change the advanced settings of the autoshape, right-click it and select the Advanced Settings option in the menu or use the Show advanced settings link at the right sidebar. The 'Shape - Advanced Settings' window will open: The Size tab contains the following parameters: Width - use one of these options to change the autoshape width. Absolute - specify an exact value measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab). Relative - specify a percentage relative to the left margin width, the margin (i.e. the distance between the left and right margins), the page width, or the right margin width. Height - use one of these options to change the autoshape height. Absolute - specify an exact value measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab). Relative - specify a percentage relative to the margin (i.e. the distance between the top and bottom margins), the bottom margin height, the page height, or the top margin height. If the Lock aspect ratio option is checked, the width and height will be changed together preserving the original shape aspect ratio. The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Wrapping Style - use this option to change the way the shape is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles). Inline - the shape is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the shape moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible. If one of the following styles is selected, the shape can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly: Square - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the shape. Tight - the text wraps the actual shape edges. Through - the text wraps around the shape edges and fills in the open white space within the shape. So that the effect can appear, use the Edit Wrap Boundary option from the right-click menu. Top and bottom - the text is only above and below the shape. In front - the shape overlaps the text. Behind - the text overlaps the shape. If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom style you will be able to set up some additional parameters - distance from text at all sides (top, bottom, left, right). The Position tab is available only if you select a wrapping style other than inline. This tab contains the following parameters that vary depending on the selected wrapping style: The Horizontal section allows you to select one of the following three autoshape positioning types: Alignment (left, center, right) relative to character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) to the right of character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the left margin, margin, page or right margin. The Vertical section allows you to select one of the following three autoshape positioning types: Alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) below line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the margin, bottom margin, page or top margin. Move object with text controls whether the autoshape moves as the text to which it is anchored moves. Allow overlap controls whether two autoshapes overlap or not if you drag them near each other on the page. The Shape Settings tab contains the following parameters: Line Style - this option group allows to specify the following parameters: Cap Type - this option allows to set the style for the end of the line, therefore it can be applied only to the shapes with the open outline, such as lines, polylines etc.: Flat - the end points will be flat. Round - the end points will be rounded. Square - the end points will be square. Join Type - this option allows to set the style for the intersection of two lines, for example, it can affect a polyline or the corners of the triangle or rectangle outline: Round - the corner will be rounded. Bevel - the corner will be cut off angularly. Miter - the corner will be pointed. It goes well to shapes with sharp angles. Note: the effect will be more noticeable if you use a large outline width. Arrows - this option group is available if a shape from the Lines shape group is selected. It allows to set the arrow Start and End Style and Size by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown lists. The Text Padding tab allows to change the autoshape Top, Bottom, Left and Right internal margins (i.e. the distance between the text within the shape and the autoshape borders). Note: this tab is only available if text is added within the autoshape, otherwise the tab is disabled. The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the shape."

You can hide the gridlines at all using the None option. Note: the Axis Settings and Gridlines sections will be disabled for Pie charts since charts of this type have no axes and gridlines. Note: the Vertical/Horizontal Axis tabs will be disabled for Pie charts since charts of this type have no axes. The Vertical Axis tab allows you to change the parameters of the vertical axis also referred to as the values axis or y-axis which displays numeric values. Note that the vertical axis will be the category axis which displays text labels for the Bar charts, therefore in this case the Vertical Axis tab options will correspond to the ones described in the next section. For the XY (Scatter) charts, both axes are value axes. The Axis Options section allows to set the following parameters: Minimum Value - is used to specify a lowest value displayed at the vertical axis start. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the minimum value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Fixed option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right. Maximum Value - is used to specify a highest value displayed at the vertical axis end. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the maximum value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Fixed option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right. Axis Crosses - is used to specify a point on the vertical axis where the horizontal axis should cross it. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the axes intersection point value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Value option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right, or set the axes intersection point at the Minimum/Maximum Value on the vertical axis. Display Units - is used to determine a representation of the numeric values along the vertical axis. This option can be useful if you're working with great numbers and wish the values on the axis to be displayed in more compact and readable way (e.g. you can represent 50 000 as 50 by using the Thousands display units). Select desired units from the drop-down list: Hundreds, Thousands, 10 000, 100 000, Millions, 10 000 000, 100 000 000, Billions, Trillions, or choose the None option to return to the default units. Values in reverse order - is used to display values in an opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, the lowest value is at the bottom and the highest value is at the top of the axis. When the box is checked, the values are ordered from top to bottom. The Tick Options section allows to adjust the appearance of tick marks on the vertical scale. Major tick marks are the larger scale divisions which can have labels displaying numeric values. Minor tick marks are the scale subdivisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels. Tick marks also define where gridlines can be displayed, if the corresponding option is set at the Layout tab. The Major/Minor Type drop-down lists contain the following placement options: None to not display major/minor tick marks, Cross to display major/minor tick marks on both sides of the axis, In to display major/minor tick marks inside the axis, Out to display major/minor tick marks outside the axis.

The Horizontal Axis tab allows you to change the parameters of the horizontal axis also referred to as the categories axis or x-axis which displays text labels. Note that the horizontal axis will be the value axis which displays numeric values for the Bar charts, therefore in this case the Horizontal Axis tab options will correspond to the ones described in the previous section. For the XY (Scatter) charts, both axes are value axes. The Axis Options section allows to set the following parameters: Axis Crosses - is used to specify a point on the horizontal axis where the vertical axis should cross it. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the axes intersection point value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Value option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right, or set the axes intersection point at the Minimum/Maximum Value (that corresponds to the first and last category) on the horizontal axis. Axis Position - is used to specify where the axis text labels should be placed: On Tick Marks or Between Tick Marks. Values in reverse order - is used to display categories in an opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, categories are displayed from left to right. When the box is checked, the categories are ordered from right to left. The Tick Options section allows to adjust the appearance of tick marks on the horizontal scale. Major tick marks are the larger divisions which can have labels displaying category values. Minor tick marks are the smaller divisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels.

Distance from text - is used to specify the amount of space between the text of the paragraph and the right border of the frame that surrounds the drop cap. The Borders &amp; Fill tab allows to add a border around the drop cap and adjust its parameters. They are the following: Border parameters (size, color and presence or absence) - set the border size, select its color and choose the borders (top, bottom, left, right or their combination) you want to apply these settings to. Background color - choose the color for the drop cap background. The Margins tab allows to set the distance between the drop cap and the Top, Bottom, Left and Right borders around it (if the borders have previously been added). Once the drop cap is added you can also change the Frame parameters. To access them, right click within the frame and select the Frame Advanced Settings from the menu. The Frame - Advanced Settings window will open: The Frame tab allows to set the following parameters: Position - is used to select the Inline or Flow wrapping style. Or you can click None to delete the frame. Width and Height - are used to change the frame dimensions. The Auto option allows to automatically adjust the frame size to fit the drop cap in it. The Exactly option allows to specify fixed values. The At least option is used to set the minimum height value (if you change the drop cap size, the frame height changes accordingly, but it cannot be less than the specified value). Horizontal parameters are used either to set the frame exact position in the selected units of measurement relative to a margin, page or column, or to align the frame (left, center or right) relative to one of these reference points. You can also set the horizontal Distance from text i.e. the amount of space between the vertical frame borders and the text of the paragraph. Vertical parameters are used either to set the frame exact position in the selected units of measurement relative to a margin, page or paragraph, or to align the frame (top, center or bottom) relative to one of these reference points. You can also set the vertical Distance from text i.e. the amount of space between the horizontal frame borders and the text of the paragraph. Move with text - controls whether the frame moves as the paragraph to which it is anchored moves. The Borders &amp; Fill and Margins tabs allow to set just the same parameters as at the tabs of the same name in the Drop Cap - Advanced Settings window."

For example, if the text within a cell exceeds the specified width, it will be broken into the next line so that the preferred cell width remains unchanged, but if you insert a new column, the preferred width will be reduced. Measure in - allows to specify if you want to set the cell width in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) or in Percent of the overall table width. Note: you can also adjust the cell width manually. To make a single cell in a column wider or narrower than the overall column width, select the necessary cell and move the mouse cursor over its right border until it turns into the bidirectional arrow, then drag the border. To change the width of all the cells in a column, use the markers on the horizontal ruler to change the column width. The Cell Margins section allows to adjust the space between the text within the cells and the cell border. By default, standard values are used (the default values can also be altered at the Table tab), but you can uncheck the Use default margins box and enter the necessary values manually. The Cell Options section allows to change the following parameter: The Wrap text option is enabled by default. It allows to wrap text within a cell that exceeds its width onto the next line expanding the row height and keeping the column width unchanged.

To make them disappear at all, click the Nonprinting characters icon at the Home tab of the top toolbar and select the Hidden Table Borders option. Cell Background - the color for the background within the cells (available only if one or more cells are selected or the Allow spacing between cells option is selected at the Table tab). Table Background - the color for the table background or the space background between the cells in case the Allow spacing between cells option is selected at the Table tab. The Table Position tab is available only if the Flow table option at the Text Wrapping tab is selected and contains the following parameters: Horizontal parameters include the table alignment (left, center, right) relative to margin, page or text as well as the table position to the right of margin, page or text. Vertical parameters include the table alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to margin, page or text as well as the table position below margin, page or text. The Options section allows to change the following parameters: Move object with text controls whether the table moves as the text into which it is inserted moves. Allow overlap controls whether two tables are merged into one large table or overlap if you drag them near each other on the page. The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Text wrapping style - Inline table or Flow table. Use the necessary option to change the way the table is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline table) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select the flow table). After you select the wrapping style, the additional wrapping parameters can be set both for inline and flow tables: For the inline table, you can specify the table alignment and indent from left. For the flow table, you can specify the distance from text and table position at the Table Position tab. The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the table."

After you click it, the Send to Email window will open: In the From list, select the mail account you want to use for sending mail, if you have several accounts connected in the Mail module. In the To list, select the merge field corresponding to email addresses of the recipients, if it was not selected automatically. Enter your message subject in the Subject Line field. Select the mail format from the list: HTML, Attach as DOCX or Attach as PDF. When one of the two latter options is selected, you also need to specify the File name for attachments and enter the Message (the text of your letter that will be sent to recipients). Click the Send button. Once the mailing is over you'll receive a notification to your email specified in the From field."
