Letter R indicates the row number and letter C indicates the column number. In case you refer to other cells using the R1C1 reference style, the reference to a target cell is formed based on the distance from an active cell. For example, when you select the cell in row 5 and column 1 and refer to the cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is R[-2]C[1]. The numbers in square brackets designate the position of the cell relative to the current cell position, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows up and 1 column to the right of the active cell. If you select the cell in row 1 and column 2 and refer to the same cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is R[2]C, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows down from the active cell and in the same column.

Array formulas ensure consistency among formulas in a spreadsheet, as you can enter a single array formula instead of several usual formulas, they simplify working with large amount of data, allow you to quickly fill a sheet with data, and much more. You can enter formulas and built-in functions as array formulas in order to: perform multiple calculations at once and display a single result, or return a range of values displayed in multiple rows or/and columns. There are also specially designated functions which can return multiple values. If you enter them by pressing Enter, they return a single value. If you select an output range of cells to display the results and then enter a function by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Enter, it returns a range of values (the number of returned values depends on the size of the previously selected output range). The list below contains links to detailed descriptions of these functions.

Enter the formula you want to use in the formula bar, specifying necessary arguments within parentheses (). Press the Ctrl + Shift + Enter key combination. The results will be displayed in the selected range of cells, and the formula in the formula bar will be automatically enclosed in the curly braces { } to indicate that it is an array formula. For example, {=UNIQUE(B2:D6)}. These braces cannot be entered manually. Create a single-cell array formula The following example illustrates the result of the array formula displayed in a single cell. Select a cell, enter =SUM(C2:C11*D2:D11), and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Create a multi-cell array formula The following example illustrates the results of the array formula displayed in a range of cells. Select a range of cells, enter =C2:C11*D2:D11, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Edit array formulas Every time you edit an entered array formula (e.g., change arguments), you need to press the Ctrl + Shift + Enter key combination to save the changes. The following example explains how to expand a multi-cell array formula when you add new data. Select all the cells which contain an array formula, as well as empty cells next to new data, edit arguments in the formula bar so that they include new data, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. If you want to apply a multi-cell array formula to a smaller range of cells, you need to delete the current array formula and then enter a new array formula. A part of the array cannot be modified or deleted. If you try to edit, move, or delete a single cell within the array, or insert a new cell to the array, you get the following warning: You cannot change part of an array. To delete an array formula, select all the cells which contain the array formula and press Delete. Alternatively, select the array formula in the formula bar, press Delete and then press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Examples of array formula usage This section provides some examples on how to use array formulas to perform certain tasks. Count a number of characters in a range of cells You can use the following array formula, replacing the cell range in the argument with your own one: =SUM(LEN(B2:B11)). The LEN function calculates the length of each text string in the range of cells. The SUM function adds the values together. To get the average number of characters, replace SUM with AVERAGE. Find the longest string in a range of cells You can use the following array formula, replacing cell ranges in arguments with your own ones: =INDEX(B2:B11,MATCH(MAX(LEN(B2:B11)),LEN(B2:B11),0),1). The LEN function calculates the length of each text string in the range of cells. The MAX function calculates the largest value. The MATCH function finds the address of the cell with the longest string. The INDEX function returns the value from the found cell. To find the shortest string, replace MAX with MIN. Sum values based on conditions To sum values greater than a specified number (2 in this example), you can use the following array formula, replacing cell ranges in arguments with your own ones: =SUM(IF(C2:C11>2,C2:C11)). The IF function creates an array of positive and false values. The SUM function ignores false values and adds the positive values together."

The 'Shape - Advanced Settings' window will open: The Size tab contains the following parameters: Width and Height - use these options to change the width and/or height of the autoshape. If the Constant proportions button is clicked (in this case it looks like this ), the width and height will be changed together preserving the original shape aspect ratio. The Rotation tab contains the following parameters: Angle - use this option to rotate the shape by an exactly specified angle. Enter the necessary value measured in degrees into the field or adjust it using the arrows on the right. Flipped - check the Horizontally box to flip the shape horizontally (left to right) or check the Vertically box to flip the shape vertically (upside down). The Weights &amp; Arrows tab contains the following parameters: Line Style - this option group allows you to specify the following parameters: Cap Type - this option allows you to set the style of the end of the line, therefore it can be applied only to the shapes with an open outline, such as lines, polylines etc.: Flat - the end points will be flat. Round - the end points will be rounded. Square - the end points will be square. Join Type - this option allows you to set the style of the intersection of two lines, for example, it can affect a polyline or the corners of a triangle or rectangle outline: Round - the corner will be rounded. Bevel - the corner will be cut off angularly. Miter - the corner will be pointed. It goes well to shapes with sharp angles. Note: the effect will be more noticeable if you use a large outline width. Arrows - this option group is available if a shape from the Lines shape group is selected. It allows you to set the arrow Start and End Style and Size by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown lists. The Text Box tab allows you to Resize shape to fit text, Allow text to overflow shape or change the Top, Bottom, Left and Right internal margins of the autoshape (i.e. the distance between the text within the shape and the autoshape borders). Note: this tab is only available if text is added within the autoshape, otherwise the tab is disabled. The Columns tab allows you to add columns of text within the autoshape specifying the necessary Number of columns (up to 16) and Spacing between columns. Once you click OK, the text that already exists or any other text you enter within the autoshape will appear in columns and will flow from one column to another one. The Cell Snapping tab contains the following parameters: Move and size with cells - this option allows you to snap the shape to the cell behind it. If the cell moves (e.g. if you insert or delete some rows/columns), the shape will be moved together with the cell. If you increase or decrease the width or height of the cell, the shape will change its size as well. Move but don't size with cells - this option allows you to snap the shape to the cell behind it preventing the shape from being resized. If the cell moves, the shape will be moved together with the cell, but if you change the cell size, the shape dimensions remain unchanged. Don't move or size with cells - this option allows you to prevent the shape from being moved or resized if the cell position or size was changed. The Alternative Text tab allows you to specify the Title and Description which will be read to people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information the shape contains. Insert and format text within the autoshape To insert a text into the autoshape, select the shape with the mouse and start typing your text. The text will become part of the autoshape (when you move or rotate the shape, the text also moves or rotates with it). All the formatting options you can apply to the text within the autoshape are listed here. Join autoshapes using connectors You can connect autoshapes using lines with connection points to demonstrate dependencies between the objects (e.g. if you want to create a flowchart). To do that, click the Shape icon on the Insert tab of the top toolbar, select the Lines group from the menu, click the necessary shape within the selected group (excepting the last three shapes which are not connectors, namely Curve, Scribble and Freeform), hover the mouse cursor over the first autoshape and click one of the connection points that appear on the shape outline, drag the mouse cursor towards the second autoshape and click the necessary connection point on its outline. If you move the joined autoshapes, the connector remains attached to the shapes and moves together with them. You can also detach the connector from the shapes and then attach it to any other connection points. Assign a Macro to a Shape You can provide a quick and easy access to a macro within a spreadsheet by assigning a macro to any shape. Once you assign a macro, the shape appears as a button control and you can run the macro whenever you click it. To assign a macro: Right-click the shape to assign a macro to and choose the Assign Macro option from the drop-down menu.

        "body": "Using Sparklines Sparkline is a small chart that fits into a cell to represent trends or variations of data. Sparklines have limited functionality compared with regular charts but are an excellent tool to quickly analyze your data and to create a concise visual representation. Sparkline size depends on the size of the cell, change cell width and length to adjust the size. After adding a sparkline, you can still type text or add conditional formatting into the cell. ONLYOFFICE Spreadsheet Editor offers three types of sparklines: Column is similar to a regular Column Chart. Line is similar to a regular Line Chart. Win/Loss is suitable for representing data that include both positive and negative values. Insert Sparklines To insert a Sparkline chart, select the data range to include in the sparkline, or click a blank cell where to place it, go to the Insert tab and click the Sparkline button on the top toolbar. Choose a sparkline that serves your purpose. The Create Sparklines window will open, click the Select data icon to specify the data range, and the location of the sparkline, click OK to confirm Edit and Format Sparklines After inserting a sparkline, you can customize and edit it. Click the cell with a sparkline to enable the Sparkline settings tab on the right sidebar. In the Type section, you can select one of the available sparkline types drop-down list: Column - this type is similar to a regular Column Chart. Line - this type is similar to a regular Line Chart. Win/Loss - this type is suitable for representing data that include both positive and negative values. In the Style section, you can select the style which suits you best from the Template drop-down list, the necessary Color for the sparkline, and the necessary Line Weight (available for the Line sparkline only) In the Show section, you can highlight or mark certain data in the sparkline: High Point – use it to highlight the maximum value. Low Point – use it to highlight the minimum value. Negative Point – use it to highlight negative values. First Point – use it to highlight the starting point in the data range. Last Point - use it to highlight the end point in the data range. Markers – is available for Line sparklines only, use it to enable a marker for all points. Click the down arrow in the color box to select a color for each point. If you need to make your sparkline more accurate and easier to read, click the Show advanced settings option to open the Sparkline – Advanced Settings window. The Type &amp Data tab allows you to change the sparkline Type and Style as well as specify the Hidden and Empty cells display settings: Show empty cells as - this option allows you to control how sparklines are displayed if some cells in a data range are empty. Select the necessary option from the list: Gaps - to display the sparkline with gaps in place of missing data, Zero - to display the sparkline as if the value in an empty cell was zero, Connect data points with line (available for the Line type only) - to ignore empty cells and display a connecting line between data points. Show data in hidden rows and columns - check this box if you want to include values from the hidden cells into sparklines. The Axis Options tab allows you to specify the following Horizontal/Vertical Axis parameters: In the Horizontal Axis section, the following parameters are available: Show axis - check this box to display the horizontal axis. If the source data contain negative values, this option helps to display them more vividly. Reverse order - check this box to display data in the reverse sequence. In the Vertical Axis section, the following parameters are available to define the Minimum/Maximum Value: Minimum/Maximum Value Auto for Each - this option is selected by default. It allows you to use own minimum/maximum values for each sparkline. The minimum/maximum values are taken from the separate data series that are used to plot each sparkline. The maximum value for each sparkline will be located at the top of the cell, and the minimum value will be at the bottom. Same for All - this option allows you to use the same minimum/maximum value for the entire sparkline group. The minimum/maximum values are taken from the whole data range that is used to plot the sparkline group. The maximum/minimum values for each sparkline will be scaled relative to the highest/lowest value within the range. If you select this option, it will be easier to compare several sparklines. Fixed - this option allows you to set a custom minimum/maximum value. The values which are lower or higher than the specified ones are not displayed in the sparklines. Clear Sparklines To delete sparklines, select the cell(s) with the sparkline(s) to be removed and right-click on it.

        "body": "Pivot tables allow you to group and arrange data of large data sets to get summarized information. In the Spreadsheet Editor you can reorganize data in many different ways to display only the necessary information and focus on important aspects. Create a new pivot table To create a pivot table, Prepare the source data set you want to use for creating a pivot table. It should include column headers. The data set should not contain empty rows or columns. Select any cell within the source data range. Switch to the Pivot Table tab of the top toolbar and click the Insert Table icon. If you want to create a pivot table on the base of a formatted table, you can also use the Insert pivot table option on the Table settings tab of the right sidebar. The Create Pivot Table window will appear. The Source data range is already specified. In this case, all data from the source data range will be used. If you want to change the data range (e.g. to include only a part of source data), click the icon. In the Select Data Range window, enter the necessary data range in the following format: Sheet1!$A$1:$E$10. You can also select the necessary cell range on the sheet using the mouse. When ready, click OK. Specify where you want to place the pivot table. The New worksheet option is selected by default. It allows you to place the pivot table in a new worksheet. You can also select the Existing worksheet option and choose a certain cell. In this case, the selected cell will be the upper right cell of the created pivot table. To select a cell, click the icon. In the Select Data Range window, enter the cell address in the following format: Sheet1!$G$2. You can also click the necessary cell in the sheet. When ready, click OK. When you select the pivot table location, click OK in the Create Table window. An empty pivot table will be inserted in the selected location. The Pivot table settings tab on the right sidebar will be opened. You can hide or display this tab by clicking the icon. Pivot table settings are also available in the context menu that appears when you right click the table. The context menu options depend on the field you click. Select fields to display The Select Fields section contains the fields named according to the column headers in your source data set. Each field contains values from the corresponding column of the source table. The following four sections are available below: Filters, Columns, Rows, and Values. Check the fields you want to display in the pivot table. When you check a field, it will be added to one of the available sections on the right sidebar depending on the data type and will be displayed in the pivot table. Fields containing text values will be added to the Rows section; fields containing numeric values will be added to the Values section. You can simply drag fields to the necessary section as well as drag the fields between sections to quickly reorganize your pivot table. To remove a field from the current section, drag it out of this section. In order to add a field to the necessary section, it's also possible to click the black arrow to the right of a field in the Select Fields section and choose the necessary option from the menu: Add to Filters, Add to Rows, Add to Columns, Add to Values. Below you can see some examples of using the Filters, Columns, Rows, and Values sections. If you add a field to the Filters section, a separate filter will be added above the pivot table. It will be applied to the entire pivot table. If you click the drop-down arrow in the added filter, you'll see the values from the selected field. When you uncheck some values in the filter option window and click OK, the unchecked values will not be displayed in the pivot table. If you add a field to the Columns section, the pivot table will contain a number of columns equal to the number of values from the selected field. The Grand Total column will also be added. If you add a field to the Rows section, the pivot table will contain a number of rows equal to the number of values from the selected field. The Grand Total row will also be added. If you add a field to the Values section, the pivot table will display the summation value for all numeric values from the selected field. If the field contains text values, the count of values will be displayed. The function used to calculate the summation value can be changed in the field settings. To see more information regarding any value field, click it with the right mouse button to open the context menu and choose the Show details option, or double click the required value field with the left mouse button. The data that the value field is based on will open in a new sheet. Rearrange fields and adjust their properties Once the fields are added to the necessary sections, you can manage them to change the layout and format of the pivot table. Click the black arrow to the right of a field within the Filters, Columns, Rows, or Values sections to access the field context menu. It allows you to: Move the selected field Up, Down, to the Beginning, or to the End of the current section if you have added more than one field to the current section. Move the selected field to a different section - to Filters, Columns, Rows, or Values. The option that corresponds to the current section will be disabled. Remove the selected field from the current section. Adjust the selected field settings. The Filters, Columns, and Rows field settings look similarly: The Layout tab contains the following options: The Source name option allows you to view the field name corresponding to the column header from the source data set. The Custom name option allows you to change the name of the selected field displayed in the pivot table. The Report Form section allows you to change the way the selected field is displayed in the pivot table: Choose the necessary layout for the selected field in the pivot table: The Tabular form displays one column for each field and provides space for field headers. The Outline form displays one column for each field and provides space for field headers. It also allows you to display subtotals at the top of groups. The Compact form displays items from different row section fields in a single column. The Number format option allows you to choose the required number format for the value field. Click this button, choose the required format from the Category list, then click OK when ready. To learn more about number formats, please refer to the following article. The Repeat items labels at each row option allows you to visually group rows or columns together if you have multiple fields in the tabular form. The Insert blank rows after each item option allows you to add blank lines after items of the selected field.

The number of unique values in the filtered range is displayed to the right of each value within the filter window. Note: the {Blanks} check box corresponds to the empty cells. It is available if the selected cell range contains at least one empty cell. To facilitate the process, make use of the search field on the top. Enter your query, entirely or partially, in the field - the values that include these characters will be displayed in the list below. The following two options will be also available: Select All Search Results - is checked by default. It allows selecting all the values that correspond to your query in the list. Add current selection to filter - if you check this box, the selected values will not be hidden when you apply the filter. After you select all the necessary data, click the OK button in the Filter option list to apply the filter. Filter data by certain criteria Depending on the data in the selected column, you can choose either the Number filter or the Text filter option on the right side of the Filter options list, and then select one of the options from the submenu: For the Number filter the following options are available: Equals..., Does not equal..., Greater than..., Greater than or equal to..., Less than..., Less than or equal to..., Between, Top 10, Above Average, Below Average, Custom Filter.... For the Text filter the following options are available: Equals..., Does not equal..., Begins with..., Does not begin with..., Ends with..., Does not end with..., Contains..., Does not contain..., Custom Filter.... After you select one of the above options (apart from Top 10 and Above/Below Average), the Custom Filter window will open. The corresponding criterion will be selected in the upper drop-down list. Enter the necessary value in the field on the right. To add one more criterion, use the And radiobutton if you need the data to satisfy both criteria or click the Or radiobutton if either or both criteria can be satisfied. Then select the second criterion from the lower drop-down list and enter the necessary value on the right. Click OK to apply the filter. If you choose the Custom Filter... option from the Number/Text filter option list, the first criterion is not selected automatically, you can set it yourself. If you choose the Top 10 option from the Number filter option list, a new window will open: The first drop-down list allows choosing if you wish to display the highest (Top) or the lowest (Bottom) values. The second field allows specifying how many entries from the list or which percent of the overall entries number you want to display (you can enter a number from 1 to 500). The third drop-down list allows setting the units of measure: Item or Percent. Once the necessary parameters are set, click OK to apply the filter. If you choose the Above/Below Average option from the Number filter option list, the filter will be applied right now. Filter data by color If the cell range you want to filter contains some cells you have formatted changing their background or font color (manually or using predefined styles), you can use one of the following options: Filter by cells color - to display only the entries with a certain cell background color and hide other ones, Filter by font color - to display only the entries with a certain cell font color and hide other ones. When you select the necessary option, a palette that contains colors used in the selected cell range will open. Choose one of the colors to apply the filter. The Filter button will appear in the first cell of the column. It means that the filter is applied. The number of filtered records will be displayed at the status bar (e.g. 25 of 80 records filtered). Note: when the filter is applied, the rows that are filtered out cannot be modified when autofilling, formatting, deleting the visible contents. Such actions affect the visible rows only, the rows that are hidden by the filter remain unchanged. When copying and pasting the filtered data, only visible rows can be copied and pasted. This is not equivalent to manually hidden rows which are affected by all similar actions. Sort filtered data You can set the sorting order of the data you have enabled or applied filter for. Click the drop-down arrow or the Filter button and select one of the options in the Filter option list: Sort Lowest to Highest - allows sorting the data in ascending order, displaying the lowest value on the top of the column, Sort Highest to Lowest - allows sorting the data in descending order, displaying the highest value on the top of the column, Sort by cells color - allows selecting one of the colors and displaying the entries with the same cell background color on the top of the column, Sort by font color - allows selecting one of the colors and displaying the entries with the same font color on the top of the column. The latter two options can be used if the cell range you want to sort contains some cells you have formatted changing their background or font color (manually or using predefined styles). The sorting direction will be indicated by an arrow in the filter buttons. if the data is sorted in ascending order, the drop-down arrow in the first cell of the column looks like this: and the Filter button looks the following way: . if the data is sorted in descending order, the drop-down arrow in the first cell of the column looks like this: and the Filter button looks the following way: . You can also quickly sort the data by color using the contextual menu options: right-click a cell containing the color by which you want to sort the data, select the Sort option from the menu, select the necessary option from the submenu: Selected Cell Color on top - to display the entries with the same cell background color on the top of the column, Selected Font Color on top - to display the entries with the same font color on the top of the column. Filter by the selected cell contents You can also quickly filter your data by the selected cell contents using the contextual menu options. Right-click a cell, select the Filter option from the menu and then select one of the available options: Filter by Selected cell's value - to display only the entries with the same value as the selected cell contains. Filter by cell's color - to display only the entries with the same cell background color as the selected cell has. Filter by font color - to display only the entries with the same cell font color as the selected cell has. Format as Table Template To facilitate your work with data, the Spreadsheet Editor allows you to apply a table template to a selected cell range automatically enabling the filter. To do that, select a range of cells you need to format, click the Format as table template icon situated on the Home tab of the top toolbar. select the required template in the gallery, in the opened pop-up window check the cell range to be formatted as a table, check the Title if you wish the table headers to be included in the selected cell range, otherwise the header row will be added at the top while the selected cell range will be moved one row down, click the OK button to apply the selected template. The template will be applied to the selected range of cells and you will be able to edit the table headers and apply the filter to work with your data. To learn more on working with formatted tables, please refer to this page. Reapply Filter If the filtered data has been changed, you can refresh the filter to display an up-to-date result: click the Filter button in the first cell of the column that contains the filtered data, select the Reapply option in the opened Filter option list. You can also right-click a cell within the column that contains the filtered data and select the Reapply option from the contextual menu. Clear Filter To clear the filter, click the Filter button in the first cell of the column that contains the filtered data, select the Clear option in the opened Filter option list. You can also proceed in the following way: select the range of cells containing the filtered data, click the Clear filter icon situated on the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar. The filter will remain enabled, but all the applied filter parameters will be removed, and the Filter buttons in the first cells of the columns will change into the drop-down arrows . Remove Filter To remove the filter, select the range of cells containing the filtered data, click the Filter icon situated on the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar. The filter will be disabled, and the drop-down arrows will disappear from the first cells of the columns. Sort data by several columns/rows To sort data by several columns/rows you can create several sorting levels using the Custom Sort function. select a cell range you wish to sort (you can select a single cell to sort the entire range), click the Custom Sort icon situated on the Data tab of the top toolbar, the Sort window will appear. Sorting by columns is selected by default. use the Levels sections to add new levels and to manage the added levels.

        "title": "Use named ranges", 
        "body": "Names are meaningful notations that can be assigned to a cell or cell range and used to simplify working with formulas in the Spreadsheet Editor. Creating a formula, you can insert a name as its argument instead of using a reference to a cell range. For example, if you assign the Annual_Income name to a cell range, it will be possible to enter =SUM(Annual_Income) instead of =SUM(B1:B12). Thus, formulas become clearer. This feature can also be useful in case a lot of formulas are referred to one and the same cell range. If the range address is changed, you can make the correction once by using the Name Manager instead of editing all the formulas one by one. There are two types of names that can be used: Defined name – an arbitrary name that you can specify for a certain cell range. Defined names also include the names created automatically when setting up print areas. Table name – a default name that is automatically assigned to a new formatted table (Table1, Table2 etc.). You can edit this name later. If you have created a slicer for a formatted table, an automatically assigned slicer name will also be displayed in the Name Manager (Slicer_Column1, Slicer_Column2 etc. This name consists of the Slicer_ part and the field name corresponding to the column header from the source data set). You can edit this name later. Names are also classified by Scope, i.e. the location where a name is recognized. A name can be scoped to the whole workbook (it will be recognized for any worksheet within this workbook) or to a separate worksheet (it will be recognized for the specified worksheet only). Each name must be unique within a single scope, the same names can be used within different scopes. Create new names To create a new defined name for a selection: Select a cell or cell range you want to assign a name to. Open a new name window in a suitable way: Right-click the selection and choose the Define Name option from the contextual menu, or click the Named ranges icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar and select the Define Name option from the menu. or click the  Named ranges button on the Formula tab of the top toolbar and select the Name manager option from the menu. Choose option New in the opened window. The New Name window will open: Enter the necessary Name in the text entry field. Note: a name cannot start with a number, contain spaces or punctuation marks. Underscores (_) are allowed. Case does not matter. Specify the name Scope. The Workbook scope is selected by default, but you can specify an individual worksheet selecting it from the list. Check the selected Data Range address. If necessary, you can change it. Click the icon - the Select Data Range window will open. Change the link to the cell range in the entry field or select a new range on the worksheet with the mouse and click OK. Click OK to save the new name. To quickly create a new name for the selected cell range, you can also enter the desired name into the name box located to the left of the the formula bar and press Enter. The name created in such a way is scoped to the Workbook. Manage names All the existing names can be accessed via the Name Manager. To open it: click the Named ranges icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar and select the Name manager option from the menu, or click the arrow in the name field and select the Name Manager option. The Name Manager window will open: For your convenience, you can filter the names selecting the name category you want to be displayed: All, Defined names, Table names, Names Scoped to Sheet or Names Scoped to Workbook. The names that belong to the selected category will be displayed in the list, the other names will be hidden. To change the sort order for the displayed list, you can click on the Named Ranges or Scope titles in this window. To edit a name, select it in the list and click the Edit button. The Edit Name window will open: For a defined name, you can change the name and the data range it refers to. For a table name, you can change the name only. When all the necessary changes are made, click OK to apply them. To discard the changes, click Cancel. If the edited name is used in a formula, the formula will be automatically changed accordingly. To delete a name, select it in the list and click the Delete button. Note: if you delete the name that is used in a formula, the formula will no longer work (it will return the #NAME? error). You can also create a new name in the Name Manager window by clicking the New button. Use names when working with the spreadsheet To quickly navigate through cell ranges, you can click the arrow in the name box and select the necessary name from the name list – the data range that corresponds to this name will be selected in the worksheet. Note: the name list displays the defined names and table names scoped to the current worksheet and to the whole workbook. To add a name as an argument of a formula: Place the insertion point where you need to add a name. Make one of the following steps: enter the name of the necessary named range manually using the keyboard. Once you type the initial letters, the Formula Autocomplete list will be displayed. As you type, the items (formulas and names) that match the entered characters are displayed in it. You can select the necessary defined name or table name from the list and insert it into the formula by double-clicking it or pressing the Tab key. or click the Named ranges icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar, select the Paste name option from the menu, choose the necessary name from the Paste Name window and click OK: Note: the Paste Name window displays the defined names and table names scoped to the current worksheet and to the whole workbook. To use a name as an internal hyperlink: Place the insertion point where you need to add a hyperlink. Go to the Insert tab and click the Hyperlink button. In the opened Hyperlink Settings window, select the Internal Data Range tab and choose a named range. Click OK."
