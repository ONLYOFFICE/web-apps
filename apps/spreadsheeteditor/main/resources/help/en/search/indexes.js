        "title": "Advanced Settings of the Spreadsheet Editor", 
        "body": "The Spreadsheet Editor allows you to change its general advanced settings. To access them, open the File tab on the top toolbar and select the Advanced Settings option. The advanced settings are grouped as follows: Editing and saving Autosave is used in the online version to turn on/off automatic saving of changes made during the editing process. Autorecover is used in the desktop version to turn on/off the option that allows you to automatically recover spreadsheets if the program closes unexpectedly. Show the Paste Options button when the content is pasted. The corresponding icon will appear when you paste content in the spreadsheet. Show function tooltip - enables tips for entering functions. Collaboration The Co-editing mode subsection allows you to set the preferable mode for seeing changes made to the spreadsheet when working in collaboration. Fast (by default). The users who take part in the spreadsheet co-editing will see the changes in real time once they are made by other users. Strict. All the changes made by co-editors will be shown only after you click the Save icon that will notify you about new changes. Show changes from other users. This feature allows seeing changes made by other users in the spreadsheet opened for viewing only in the Live Viewer mode. Show comments in text. If you disable this feature, the commented passages will be highlighted only if you click the Comments icon on the left sidebar. Show resolved comments. This feature is disabled by default so that the resolved comments are hidden in the spreadsheet. You can view such comments only if you click the Comments icon on the left sidebar. Enable this option if you want to display resolved comments in the spreadsheet. Appearance The Interface theme option is used to change the color scheme of the editor’s interface. The Same as system option makes the editor follow the interface theme of your system. The Light color scheme incorporates standard blue, white, and light gray colors with less contrast in UI elements suitable for working during daytime. The Classic Light color scheme incorporates standard blue, white, and light gray colors. The Dark color scheme incorporates black, dark gray, and light gray colors suitable for working during nighttime. The Contrast Dark color scheme incorporates black, dark gray, and white colors with more contrast in UI elements highlighting the working area of the file. The Gray color scheme incorporates lighter gray color and appears as a uniformly light color scheme. The Turn on document dark mode option is used to make the working area darker when the editor is set to Dark or Contrast Dark interface theme. Check the Turn on document dark mode box to enable it. Note: Apart from the available Light, Classic Light, Dark, Contrast Dark, and Gray interface themes, ONLYOFFICE editors can now be customized with your own color theme. Please follow these instructions to learn how you can do that. Tab style - choose whether you want the currently selected tab to be filled in with a lighter color with the Fill option or to be underlined with the Line option. Use toolbar color as tabs background - the color of the toolbar will be used as tabs background. The toolbar color depends on the currently selected interface theme. Workspace The Turn on screen reader support option is used to enable support of screen reader software. The R1C1 reference style option is disabled by default and the A1 reference style is used. When the A1 reference style is used, columns are designated by letters, and rows are designated by numbers. If you select the cell located in row 3 and column 2, its address displayed in the box to the left of the formula bar looks like this: B3. If the R1C1 reference style is enabled, both rows and columns are designated by numbers. If you select the cell at the intersection of row 3 and column 2, its address will look like this: R3C2. Letter R indicates the row number and letter C indicates the column number. In case you refer to other cells using the R1C1 reference style, the reference to a target cell is formed based on the distance from an active cell. For example, when you select the cell in row 5 and column 1 and refer to the cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is R[-2]C[1]. The numbers in square brackets designate the position of the cell relative to the current cell position, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows up and 1 column to the right of the active cell. If you select the cell in row 1 and column 2 and refer to the same cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is R[2]C, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows down from the active cell and in the same column.

        "body": "The ChatGPT plugin allows you to use the OpenAI chatbot to perform tasks that involve understanding or generating natural language or code. Starting with ONLYOFFICE Docs 8.2, no plugins come with the editors by default. The plugins shall be installed via Plugin Manager. Installation To install the ChatGPT plugin, Go to the Plugins tab. Open the Plugin Manager. Find ChatGPT on the marketplace and click the Install button below. Right-click anywhere in the document and find ChatGPT in the context menu. Click Settings to proceed with the plugin configuration. Configuration Create your API key on the OpenAI API key page. Copy the generated API key into the corresponding field of the Settings window. How to use ONLYOFFICE assumes no responsibility for any ChatGPT completions that may contain errors or omissions as well as for any harassing and inappropriate content. The information contained in the plugin completions is generated by ChatGPT and is provided on the \"as is\" basis without additional filtering from ONLYOFFICE. Once installed ChatGPT will be added to the context menu, and all of the ChatGPT features will be accessed with a right mouse click. Select a piece of text or a word to access the context menu and to choose one of the ChatGPT features: Text Analysis, Word Analysis, Translation, Image Generation, Thesaurus, Chat, and Custom Request. Chat Integration of ChatGPT into the context menu allows you to invoke the Chat from anywhere in the document. Use chatbot to interact and carry on a conversation, ask questions, and receive responses to your requests. Navigate to the Chat option from the ChatGPT context menu, and start a conversation in the text box at the bottom of the ChatGPT window. Custom Request The Custom Request feature allows you to tokenize natural language or code. The tool converts the input text into a list of tokens, processes the request, converts the generated tokens back to the text, and returns the string in the document. To make a custom request, go to the ChatGPT context menu, and click Custom request. In the Open AI text box, enter the text you would like to tokenize. The tool shows the total number of tokens in the text. Click the Show advanced settings to configure the request settings: Model - the model which will generate the completion. Some models are suitable for natural language tasks, others specialize in code. To learn more about these models, please refer to the official ChatGPT website. Maximum length - the maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. Temperature - this parameter controls randomness, e.g., lowering it results in less random completions. As the temperature approaches zero, the node will become deterministic and repetitive. Top P - an alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. Stop sequences - up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence. Click the Submit button to process the text, or click the Clear button to delete the request and enter a new one."

After that, each text value separated by the delimiter will be located in a separate cell. If there is some data in the cells to the right of the column you want to split, the data will be overwritten. Use the Auto Fill option To quickly fill multiple cells with the same data use the Auto Fill option: select a cell/cell range containing the required data, move the mouse cursor over the fill handle in the right lower corner of the cell. The cursor will turn into the black cross: drag the handle over the adjacent cells to fill them with the selected data. Note: if you need to create a series of numbers (such as 1, 2, 3, 4...; 2, 4, 6, 8... etc.) or dates, you can enter at least two starting values and quickly extend the series selecting these cells and dragging the fill handle. For a series of days of the week or months, enter the initial value and drag the fill handle. Fill cells in the column with text values If a column in your spreadsheet contains some text values, you can easily replace any value within this column or fill the next blank cell selecting one of already existing text values. Right-click the necessary cell and choose the Select from drop-down list option in the contextual menu. Select one of the available text values to replace the current one or fill an empty cell. Fill cells using the Series tool Select a cell/cell range containing the initial data and some empty cells in the necessary direction. Click the Fill icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar and choose the Series option. You can also use the Down, Right, Up, Left options to fill the selected empty cells. There is another way to access the Series window. You can select the initial data, move the mouse cursor over the fill handle in the right lower corner of the cell, click and hold the right mouse button on the fill handle, then drag down, up, right, or left and release the right mouse button - the context menu appears with the Series option. You can also use the following options to fill the selected empty cells: Copy cells is used to fill cells with the same values, Fill series is used to fill cells with a series using the default step value, Fill days is used to fill cells with a series of dates, Linear trend is available if more than one starting value is selected, is used to add the default step value to the starting value and then to each subsequent value, Growth trend is available if more than one starting value is selected, is used to multiply the starting value by the default step value.

Array formulas ensure consistency among formulas in a spreadsheet, as you can enter a single array formula instead of several usual formulas, they simplify working with large amount of data, allow you to quickly fill a sheet with data, and much more. You can enter formulas and built-in functions as array formulas in order to: perform multiple calculations at once and display a single result, or return a range of values displayed in multiple rows or/and columns. There are also specially designated functions which can return multiple values. If you enter them by pressing Enter, they return a single value. If you select an output range of cells to display the results and then enter a function by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Enter, it returns a range of values (the number of returned values depends on the size of the previously selected output range). The list below contains links to detailed descriptions of these functions.

Enter the formula you want to use in the formula bar, specifying necessary arguments within parentheses (). Press the Ctrl + Shift + Enter key combination. The results will be displayed in the selected range of cells, and the formula in the formula bar will be automatically enclosed in the curly braces { } to indicate that it is an array formula. For example, {=UNIQUE(B2:D6)}. These braces cannot be entered manually. Create a single-cell array formula The following example illustrates the result of the array formula displayed in a single cell. Select a cell, enter =SUM(C2:C11*D2:D11), and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Create a multi-cell array formula The following example illustrates the results of the array formula displayed in a range of cells. Select a range of cells, enter =C2:C11*D2:D11, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Edit array formulas Every time you edit an entered array formula (e.g., change arguments), you need to press the Ctrl + Shift + Enter key combination to save the changes. The following example explains how to expand a multi-cell array formula when you add new data. Select all the cells which contain an array formula, as well as empty cells next to new data, edit arguments in the formula bar so that they include new data, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. If you want to apply a multi-cell array formula to a smaller range of cells, you need to delete the current array formula and then enter a new array formula. A part of the array cannot be modified or deleted. If you try to edit, move, or delete a single cell within the array, or insert a new cell to the array, you get the following warning: You cannot change part of an array. To delete an array formula, select all the cells which contain the array formula and press Delete. Alternatively, select the array formula in the formula bar, press Delete and then press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Examples of array formula usage This section provides some examples on how to use array formulas to perform certain tasks. Count a number of characters in a range of cells You can use the following array formula, replacing the cell range in the argument with your own one: =SUM(LEN(B2:B11)). The LEN function calculates the length of each text string in the range of cells. The SUM function adds the values together. To get the average number of characters, replace SUM with AVERAGE. Find the longest string in a range of cells You can use the following array formula, replacing cell ranges in arguments with your own ones: =INDEX(B2:B11,MATCH(MAX(LEN(B2:B11)),LEN(B2:B11),0),1). The LEN function calculates the length of each text string in the range of cells. The MAX function calculates the largest value. The MATCH function finds the address of the cell with the longest string. The INDEX function returns the value from the found cell. To find the shortest string, replace MAX with MIN. Sum values based on conditions To sum values greater than a specified number (2 in this example), you can use the following array formula, replacing cell ranges in arguments with your own ones: =SUM(IF(C2:C11>2,C2:C11)). The IF function creates an array of positive and false values. The SUM function ignores false values and adds the positive values together."

Round - the end points will be rounded. Square - the end points will be square. Join Type - this option allows you to set the style of the intersection of two lines, for example, it can affect a polyline or the corners of a triangle or rectangle outline: Round - the corner will be rounded. Bevel - the corner will be cut off angularly. Miter - the corner will be pointed. It goes well to shapes with sharp angles. Note: the effect will be more noticeable if you use a large outline width. Arrows - this option group is available if a shape from the Lines shape group is selected. It allows you to set the arrow Start and End Style and Size by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown lists. The Text Box tab allows you to Resize shape to fit text, Allow text to overflow shape or change the Top, Bottom, Left and Right internal margins of the autoshape (i.e. the distance between the text within the shape and the autoshape borders). Note: this tab is only available if text is added within the autoshape, otherwise the tab is disabled. The Columns tab allows you to add columns of text within the autoshape specifying the necessary Number of columns (up to 16) and Spacing between columns. Once you click OK, the text that already exists or any other text you enter within the autoshape will appear in columns and will flow from one column to another one. The Cell Snapping tab contains the following parameters: Move and size with cells - this option allows you to snap the shape to the cell behind it. If the cell moves (e.g. if you insert or delete some rows/columns), the shape will be moved together with the cell. If you increase or decrease the width or height of the cell, the shape will change its size as well. Move but don't size with cells - this option allows you to snap the shape to the cell behind it preventing the shape from being resized. If the cell moves, the shape will be moved together with the cell, but if you change the cell size, the shape dimensions remain unchanged. Don't move or size with cells - this option allows you to prevent the shape from being moved or resized if the cell position or size was changed. The Alternative Text tab allows you to specify the Title and Description which will be read to people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information the shape contains. Insert and format text within the autoshape To insert a text into the autoshape, select the shape with the mouse and start typing your text. The text will become part of the autoshape (when you move or rotate the shape, the text also moves or rotates with it). All the formatting options you can apply to the text within the autoshape are listed here. Join autoshapes using connectors You can connect autoshapes using lines with connection points to demonstrate dependencies between the objects (e.g. if you want to create a flowchart). To do that, click the Shape icon on the Insert tab of the top toolbar, select the Lines group from the menu, click the necessary shape within the selected group (excepting the last three shapes which are not connectors, namely Curve, Scribble and Freeform), hover the mouse cursor over the first autoshape and click one of the connection points that appear on the shape outline, drag the mouse cursor towards the second autoshape and click the necessary connection point on its outline. If you move the joined autoshapes, the connector remains attached to the shapes and moves together with them.

        "body": "The Spreadsheet Editor allows you to build equations using the built-in templates, edit them, insert special characters (including mathematical operators, Greek letters, accents etc.). Add a new equation To insert an equation from the gallery, put the cursor within the necessary cell, switch to the Insert tab of the top toolbar, click the arrow next to the Equation icon on the top toolbar, select the required equation category in the toolbar above the inserted equation, or in the opened drop-down list select the equation category you need. The following categories are currently available: Symbols, Fractions, Scripts, Radicals, Integrals, Large Operators, Brackets, Functions, Accents, Limits and Logarithms, Operators, Matrices, click the Equation Settings symbol in the toolbar above the inserted equation to access more settings, e.g., Unicode or LaTeX, Professional or Linear, and Change to Inline, click the certain symbol/equation in the corresponding set of templates, to hide the toolbar, click the Hide Equation Toolbar option in the Equation Settings. The selected symbol/equation will be added to the worksheet. The upper left corner of the equation box will coincide with the upper left corner of the currently selected cell, but the equation box can be freely moved, resized or rotated in the sheet. To do that, click on the equation box border (it will be displayed as a solid line) and use corresponding handles. Each equation template represents a set of slots. A slot is a position of each element that makes up the equation. An empty slot (also called as a placeholder) has a dotted outline . You need to fill in all the placeholders specifying the necessary values. Enter values The insertion point specifies where the next character will appear. To position the insertion point precisely, click within a placeholder and use the keyboard arrows to move the insertion point by one character left/right. Once the insertion point is positioned, you can fill in the placeholder: enter the desired numeric/literal value using the keyboard, insert a special character using the Symbols palette from the Equation menu on the Insert tab of the top toolbar or typing them from the keyboard (see the Math AutoСorrect option description), add another equation template from the palette to create a complex nested equation. The size of the primary equation will be automatically adjusted to fit its content. The size of the nested equation elements depends on the primary equation placeholder size, but it cannot be smaller than the sub-subscript size. To add some new equation elements, you can also use the right-click menu options: To add a new argument that goes before or after the existing one within Brackets, you can right-click on the existing argument and select the Insert argument before/after option from the menu. To add a new equation within Cases with several conditions from the Brackets group, you can right-click on an empty placeholder or entered equation within it and select the Insert equation before/after option from the menu. To add a new row or a column in a Matrix, you can right-click on a placeholder within it, select the Insert option from the menu, then select Row Above/Below or Column Left/Right. Note: currently, equations cannot be entered using the linear format, i.e. \\sqrt(4&x^3). When entering the values of the mathematical expressions, you do not need to use Spacebar because the spaces between the characters and signs of operations are set automatically. If the equation is too long and does not fit a single line within the equation box, automatic line breaking occurs while you type. You can also insert a line break in a specific position by right-clicking on a mathematical operator and selecting the Insert manual break option from the menu. The selected operator will start a new line. To delete the added manual line break, right-click on the mathematical operator that starts a new line and select the Delete manual break option. Format equations By default, the equation within the equation box is horizontally centered and vertically aligned to the top of the equation box. To change its horizontal/vertical alignment, put the cursor within the equation box (the equation box borders will be displayed as dashed lines) and use the corresponding icons at the top toolbar. To increase or decrease the equation font size, click anywhere within the equation box and use the Increment font size and Decrement font size buttons on the Home tab of the top toolbar or select the necessary font size from the list.

        "title": "AutoCorrect Features", 
        "body": "The AutoCorrect features in ONLYOFFICE Spreadsheet Editor are used to automatically format text when detected or insert special math symbols by recognizing particular character usage. The available AutoCorrect options are listed in the corresponding dialog box. To access it, go to the File tab -> Advanced Settings -> Spell Checking -> Proofing -> AutoCorrect Options. The AutoCorrect dialog box consists of three tabs: Math Autocorrect, Recognized Functions, and AutoFormat As You Type. Math AutoCorrect When working with equations, you can insert a lot of symbols, accents, and mathematical operation signs typing them on the keyboard instead of choosing a template from the gallery. In the equation editor, place the insertion point within the necessary placeholder, type a math autocorrect code, then press Spacebar. The entered code will be converted into the corresponding symbol, and the space will be eliminated. Note: The codes are case sensitive. You can add, modify, restore, and remove autocorrect entries from the AutoCorrect list. Go to the File tab -> Advanced Settings -> Spell Checking -> Proofing -> AutoCorrect Options -> Math AutoCorrect. Adding an entry to the AutoCorrect list Enter the autocorrect code you want to use in the Replace box. Enter the symbol to be assigned to the code you entered in the By box. Click the Add button. Modifying an entry on the AutoCorrect list Select the entry to be modified. You can change the information in both fields: the code in the Replace box or the symbol in the By box. Click the Replace button. Removing entries from the AutoCorrect list Select an entry to remove from the list. Click the Delete button. To restore the previously deleted entries, select the entry to be restored from the list and click the Restore button. Use the Reset to default button to restore default settings. Any autocorrect entry you added will be removed and the changed ones will be restored to their original values. To disable Math AutoCorrect and to avoid automatic changes and replacements, uncheck the Replace text as you type box.

        "body": "Pivot tables allow you to group and arrange data of large data sets to get summarized information. In the Spreadsheet Editor you can reorganize data in many different ways to display only the necessary information and focus on important aspects. Create a new pivot table To create a pivot table, Prepare the source data set you want to use for creating a pivot table. It should include column headers. The data set should not contain empty rows or columns. Select any cell within the source data range. Switch to the Pivot Table tab of the top toolbar and click the Insert Table icon. If you want to create a pivot table on the base of a formatted table, you can also use the Insert pivot table option on the Table settings tab of the right sidebar. The Create Pivot Table window will appear. The Source data range is already specified. In this case, all data from the source data range will be used. If you want to change the data range (e.g. to include only a part of source data), click the icon. In the Select Data Range window, enter the necessary data range in the following format: Sheet1!$A$1:$E$10. You can also select the necessary cell range on the sheet using the mouse. When ready, click OK. Specify where you want to place the pivot table. The New worksheet option is selected by default. It allows you to place the pivot table in a new worksheet. You can also select the Existing worksheet option and choose a certain cell. In this case, the selected cell will be the upper right cell of the created pivot table. To select a cell, click the icon. In the Select Data Range window, enter the cell address in the following format: Sheet1!$G$2. You can also click the necessary cell in the sheet. When ready, click OK. When you select the pivot table location, click OK in the Create Table window. An empty pivot table will be inserted in the selected location. The Pivot table settings tab on the right sidebar will be opened. You can hide or display this tab by clicking the icon. Pivot table settings are also available in the context menu that appears when you right click the table. The context menu options depend on the field you click. Select fields to display The Select Fields section contains the fields named according to the column headers in your source data set. Each field contains values from the corresponding column of the source table. The following four sections are available below: Filters, Columns, Rows, and Values. Check the fields you want to display in the pivot table. When you check a field, it will be added to one of the available sections on the right sidebar depending on the data type and will be displayed in the pivot table. Fields containing text values will be added to the Rows section; fields containing numeric values will be added to the Values section. You can simply drag fields to the necessary section as well as drag the fields between sections to quickly reorganize your pivot table. To remove a field from the current section, drag it out of this section. In order to add a field to the necessary section, it's also possible to click the black arrow to the right of a field in the Select Fields section and choose the necessary option from the menu: Add to Filters, Add to Rows, Add to Columns, Add to Values. Below you can see some examples of using the Filters, Columns, Rows, and Values sections. If you add a field to the Filters section, a separate filter will be added above the pivot table. It will be applied to the entire pivot table. If you click the drop-down arrow in the added filter, you'll see the values from the selected field. When you uncheck some values in the filter option window and click OK, the unchecked values will not be displayed in the pivot table. If you add a field to the Columns section, the pivot table will contain a number of columns equal to the number of values from the selected field. The Grand Total column will also be added. If you add a field to the Rows section, the pivot table will contain a number of rows equal to the number of values from the selected field. The Grand Total row will also be added. If you add a field to the Values section, the pivot table will display the summation value for all numeric values from the selected field. If the field contains text values, the count of values will be displayed. The function used to calculate the summation value can be changed in the field settings. To see more information regarding any value field, click it with the right mouse button to open the context menu and choose the Show details option, or double click the required value field with the left mouse button. The data that the value field is based on will open in a new sheet. Rearrange fields and adjust their properties Once the fields are added to the necessary sections, you can manage them to change the layout and format of the pivot table. Click the black arrow to the right of a field within the Filters, Columns, Rows, or Values sections to access the field context menu. It allows you to: Move the selected field Up, Down, to the Beginning, or to the End of the current section if you have added more than one field to the current section. Move the selected field to a different section - to Filters, Columns, Rows, or Values. The option that corresponds to the current section will be disabled. Remove the selected field from the current section. Adjust the selected field settings. The Filters, Columns, and Rows field settings look similarly: The Layout tab contains the following options: The Source name option allows you to view the field name corresponding to the column header from the source data set. The Custom name option allows you to change the name of the selected field displayed in the pivot table. The Report Form section allows you to change the way the selected field is displayed in the pivot table: Choose the necessary layout for the selected field in the pivot table: The Tabular form displays one column for each field and provides space for field headers. The Outline form displays one column for each field and provides space for field headers. It also allows you to display subtotals at the top of groups. The Compact form displays items from different row section fields in a single column. The Number format option allows you to choose the required number format for the value field. Click this button, choose the required format from the Category list, then click OK when ready. To learn more about number formats, please refer to the following article. The Repeat items labels at each row option allows you to visually group rows or columns together if you have multiple fields in the tabular form. The Insert blank rows after each item option allows you to add blank lines after items of the selected field. The Show subtotals option allows you to choose if you want to display subtotals for the selected field. You can select one of the options: Show at top of group or Show at bottom of group. The Show items with no data option allows you to show or hide blank items in the selected field. The Subtotals tab allows you to choose Functions for Subtotals. Check the necessary functions in the list: Sum, Count, Average, Max, Min, Product, Count Numbers, StdDev, StdDevp, Var, Varp. Values field settings The Source name option allows you to view the field name corresponding to the column header from the source data set. The Custom name option allows you to change the name of the selected field displayed in the pivot table. The Summarize value field by option allows you to choose the function used to calculate the summation value for all values from this field. By default, Sum is used for numeric values, Count is used for text values. The available functions are Sum, Count, Average, Max, Min, Product, Count Numbers, StdDev, StdDevp, Var, Varp. The Show values as option allows you to show instant custom calculations instead of adding a formula and creating a calculated field. No calculation is the default option that displays the actual value in the field. Other calculation options: % of grand total, % of column total, % of row total, % of, % of parent row total, % of parent column total, % of parent total, Difference from, % difference from, Running total in, % running total in, Rank smallest to largest, Rank largest to smallest, Index. Use Base field and Base item when these options are available for the calculation you selected (% of, % of parent total, Difference from, % difference from, Running total in, % running total in). The Number format option allows you to choose the required number format for the value field. Click this button, choose the required format from the Category list, then click OK when ready. To learn more about number formats, please refer to the following article. Group and ungroup data Data in pivot tables can be grouped according to custom requirements. Grouping is available for dates and basic numbers. Grouping dates To group dates, create a pivot table incorporating a set of needed dates. Right click any cell in a pivot table with a date, choose the Group option in the pop-up menu, and set the needed parameters in the opened window. Starting at - the first date in the source data is chosen by default. To change it, enter the needed date in this field. Deactivate this box to ignore the starting point.

To do that, select at least one cell within the table with the mouse and click the Table settings icon on the right. click the Insert slicer option on the Table settings tab of the right sidebar. Alternatively, you can switch to the Insert tab of the top toolbar and click the Slicer button. The Insert Slicers window will be opened: check the required columns in the Insert Slicers window. click the OK button. A slicer will be added for each of the selected columns. If you add several slicers, they will overlap each other. Once the slicer is added, you can change its size and position as well as its settings. A slicer contains buttons that you can click to filter the table. The buttons corresponding to empty cells are marked with the (blank) label. When you click a slicer button, other buttons will be unselected, and the corresponding column in the source table will be filtered to only display the selected item: If you have added several slicers, the changes made in one slicer can affect the items from another slicer. When one or more filters are applied to a slicer, items with no data can appear in a different slicer (with a lighter color): You can adjust the way to display items with no data in the slicer settings. To select multiple slicer buttons, use the Multi-Select icon in the upper right corner of the slicer or press Alt+S. Select necessary slicer buttons clicking them one by one. To clear the slicer filter, use the Clear Filter icon in the upper right corner of the slicer or press Alt+C. Edit slicers Some of the slicer settings can be changed using the Slicer settings tab of the right sidebar that will open if you select the slicer with the mouse. You can hide or display this tab by clicking the icon on the right. Change the slicer size and position The Width and Height options allow you to change the width and/or height of the slicer. If the Constant proportions button is clicked (in this case it looks like this ), the width and height will be changed together preserving the original slicer aspect ratio. The Position section allows you to change the Horizontal and/or Vertical slicer position. The Disable resizing or moving option allows you to prevent the slicer from being moved or resized. When this option is checked, the Width, Height, Position, and Buttons options are disabled. Change the slicer layout and style The Buttons section allows you to specify the necessary number of Columns and set the Width and Height of the buttons. By default, a slicer contains one column. If your items contain short text, you can change the column number to 2 or more: If you increase the button width, the slicer width will change correspondingly. If you increase the button height, the scroll bar will be added to the slicer: The Style section allows you to choose one of the predefined slicer styles. Apply sorting and filtering parameters Ascending (A to Z) is used to sort the data in ascending order - from A to Z alphabetically or from the smallest to the largest number for numerical data. Descending (Z to A) is used to sort the data in descending order - from Z to A alphabetically or from the largest to the smallest for numerical data. The Hide items with no data option allows you to hide items with no data from the slicer. When this option is checked, the Visually indicate items with no data and Show items with no data last options are disabled. When the Hide items with no data option is unchecked, you can use the following options: The Visually indicate items with no data option allows you to display items with no data with different formatting (with a lighter color). If you uncheck this option, all items will be displayed with the same formatting. The Show items with no data last option allows you to display items with no data at the end of the list. If you uncheck this option, all items will be displayed in the same order as in the source table. Adjust advanced slicer settings To change the advanced slicer properties, use the Show advanced settings link on the right sidebar. The 'Slicer - Advanced Settings' window will open: The Style &amp; Size tab contains the following parameters: The Header option allows you to change the slicer header. Uncheck the Display header option if you do not want to display the slicer header. The Style section allows you to choose one of the predefined slicer styles. The Width and Height options allow you to change the width and/or height of the slicer. If the Constant proportions button is clicked (in this case it looks like this ), the width and height will be changed together preserving the original slicer aspect ratio. The Buttons section allows you to specify the necessary number of Columns and set the Height of the buttons. The Sorting &amp; Filtering tab contains the following parameters: Ascending (A to Z) is used to sort the data in ascending order - from A to Z alphabetically or from the smallest to the largest number for numerical data. Descending (Z to A) is used to sort the data in descending order - from Z to A alphabetically or from the largest to the smallest for numerical data. The Hide items with no data option allows you to hide items with no data from the slicer.

        "title": "Sort and filter data", 
        "body": "Sort Data You can quickly sort the data in the Spreadsheet Editor using one of the following options: Ascending is used to sort the data in ascending order - from A to Z alphabetically or from the smallest to the largest number for numerical data. Descending is used to sort the data in descending order - from Z to A alphabetically or from the largest to the smallest for numerical data. Note: the Sort options are accessible from both Home and Data tab. To sort the data, select a cell range you wish to sort (you can select a single cell in a range to sort the entire range), click the Sort ascending icon situated on the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar to sort the data in ascending order, OR click the Sort descending icon situated on the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar to sort the data in descending order. Note: if you select a single column/row within a cell range or a part of the column/row, you will be asked if you want to expand the selection to include adjacent cells or sort the selected data only. You can also sort your data using the contextual menu options. Right-click the selected range of cells, select the Sort option from the menu and then select Ascending or Descending option from the submenu. It's also possible to sort the data by color using the contextual menu: right-click a cell containing the color by which you want to sort the data, select the Sort option from the menu, select the necessary option from the submenu: Selected Cell Color on top - to display the entries with the same cell background color on the top of the column, Selected Font Color on top - to display the entries with the same font color on the top of the column. Filter Data To display only the rows that meet certain criteria and hide other ones, make use of the Filter option. Note: the Filter options are accessible from both Home and Data tab. To enable a filter, Select a cell range containing data to filter (you can select a single cell in a range to filter the entire range), Click the Filter icon situated at the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar. The drop-down arrow will appear in the first cell of each column of the selected cell range. It means that the filter is enabled. To apply a filter, Click the drop-down arrow .

Adjust the filter parameters. You can proceed in one of the following ways: select the data to display, filter the data by certain criteria or filter data by color. Select the data to display Uncheck the boxes near the data you need to hide. For your convenience, all the data within the Filter option list are sorted in ascending order. The number of unique values in the filtered range is displayed to the right of each value within the filter window. Note: the {Blanks} check box corresponds to the empty cells. It is available if the selected cell range contains at least one empty cell. To facilitate the process, make use of the search field on the top. Enter your query, entirely or partially, in the field - the values that include these characters will be displayed in the list below. The following two options will be also available: Select All Search Results - is checked by default. It allows selecting all the values that correspond to your query in the list. Add current selection to filter - if you check this box, the selected values will not be hidden when you apply the filter. After you select all the necessary data, click the OK button in the Filter option list to apply the filter. Filter data by certain criteria Depending on the data in the selected column, you can choose either the Number filter or the Text filter option on the right side of the Filter options list, and then select one of the options from the submenu: For the Number filter the following options are available: Equals..., Does not equal..., Greater than..., Greater than or equal to..., Less than..., Less than or equal to..., Between, Top 10, Above Average, Below Average, Custom Filter.... For the Text filter the following options are available: Equals..., Does not equal..., Begins with..., Does not begin with..., Ends with..., Does not end with..., Contains..., Does not contain..., Custom Filter.... After you select one of the above options (apart from Top 10 and Above/Below Average), the Custom Filter window will open. The corresponding criterion will be selected in the upper drop-down list. Enter the necessary value in the field on the right. To add one more criterion, use the And radiobutton if you need the data to satisfy both criteria or click the Or radiobutton if either or both criteria can be satisfied. Then select the second criterion from the lower drop-down list and enter the necessary value on the right. Click OK to apply the filter. If you choose the Custom Filter... option from the Number/Text filter option list, the first criterion is not selected automatically, you can set it yourself. If you choose the Top 10 option from the Number filter option list, a new window will open: The first drop-down list allows choosing if you wish to display the highest (Top) or the lowest (Bottom) values. The second field allows specifying how many entries from the list or which percent of the overall entries number you want to display (you can enter a number from 1 to 500). The third drop-down list allows setting the units of measure: Item or Percent. Once the necessary parameters are set, click OK to apply the filter. If you choose the Above/Below Average option from the Number filter option list, the filter will be applied right now. Filter data by color If the cell range you want to filter contains some cells you have formatted changing their background or font color (manually or using predefined styles), you can use one of the following options: Filter by cells color - to display only the entries with a certain cell background color and hide other ones, Filter by font color - to display only the entries with a certain cell font color and hide other ones. When you select the necessary option, a palette that contains colors used in the selected cell range will open. Choose one of the colors to apply the filter. The Filter button will appear in the first cell of the column. It means that the filter is applied. The number of filtered records will be displayed at the status bar (e.g. 25 of 80 records filtered). Note: when the filter is applied, the rows that are filtered out cannot be modified when autofilling, formatting, deleting the visible contents. Such actions affect the visible rows only, the rows that are hidden by the filter remain unchanged. When copying and pasting the filtered data, only visible rows can be copied and pasted. This is not equivalent to manually hidden rows which are affected by all similar actions. Sort filtered data You can set the sorting order of the data you have enabled or applied filter for. Click the drop-down arrow or the Filter button and select one of the options in the Filter option list: Sort Lowest to Highest - allows sorting the data in ascending order, displaying the lowest value on the top of the column, Sort Highest to Lowest - allows sorting the data in descending order, displaying the highest value on the top of the column, Sort by cells color - allows selecting one of the colors and displaying the entries with the same cell background color on the top of the column, Sort by font color - allows selecting one of the colors and displaying the entries with the same font color on the top of the column. The latter two options can be used if the cell range you want to sort contains some cells you have formatted changing their background or font color (manually or using predefined styles). The sorting direction will be indicated by an arrow in the filter buttons. if the data is sorted in ascending order, the drop-down arrow in the first cell of the column looks like this: and the Filter button looks the following way: . if the data is sorted in descending order, the drop-down arrow in the first cell of the column looks like this: and the Filter button looks the following way: . You can also quickly sort the data by color using the contextual menu options: right-click a cell containing the color by which you want to sort the data, select the Sort option from the menu, select the necessary option from the submenu: Selected Cell Color on top - to display the entries with the same cell background color on the top of the column, Selected Font Color on top - to display the entries with the same font color on the top of the column.

Right-click a cell, select the Filter option from the menu and then select one of the available options: Filter by Selected cell's value - to display only the entries with the same value as the selected cell contains. Filter by cell's color - to display only the entries with the same cell background color as the selected cell has. Filter by font color - to display only the entries with the same cell font color as the selected cell has. Format as Table Template To facilitate your work with data, the Spreadsheet Editor allows you to apply a table template to a selected cell range automatically enabling the filter. To do that, select a range of cells you need to format, click the Format as table template icon situated on the Home tab of the top toolbar. select the required template in the gallery, in the opened pop-up window check the cell range to be formatted as a table, check the Title if you wish the table headers to be included in the selected cell range, otherwise the header row will be added at the top while the selected cell range will be moved one row down, click the OK button to apply the selected template. The template will be applied to the selected range of cells and you will be able to edit the table headers and apply the filter to work with your data. To learn more on working with formatted tables, please refer to this page. Reapply Filter If the filtered data has been changed, you can refresh the filter to display an up-to-date result: click the Filter button in the first cell of the column that contains the filtered data, select the Reapply option in the opened Filter option list.

        "title": "Use named ranges", 
        "body": "Names are meaningful notations that can be assigned to a cell or cell range and used to simplify working with formulas in the Spreadsheet Editor. Creating a formula, you can insert a name as its argument instead of using a reference to a cell range. For example, if you assign the Annual_Income name to a cell range, it will be possible to enter =SUM(Annual_Income) instead of =SUM(B1:B12). Thus, formulas become clearer. This feature can also be useful in case a lot of formulas are referred to one and the same cell range. If the range address is changed, you can make the correction once by using the Name Manager instead of editing all the formulas one by one. There are two types of names that can be used: Defined name – an arbitrary name that you can specify for a certain cell range. Defined names also include the names created automatically when setting up print areas. Table name – a default name that is automatically assigned to a new formatted table (Table1, Table2 etc.). You can edit this name later. If you have created a slicer for a formatted table, an automatically assigned slicer name will also be displayed in the Name Manager (Slicer_Column1, Slicer_Column2 etc. This name consists of the Slicer_ part and the field name corresponding to the column header from the source data set). You can edit this name later. Names are also classified by Scope, i.e. the location where a name is recognized. A name can be scoped to the whole workbook (it will be recognized for any worksheet within this workbook) or to a separate worksheet (it will be recognized for the specified worksheet only). Each name must be unique within a single scope, the same names can be used within different scopes. Create new names To create a new defined name for a selection: Select a cell or cell range you want to assign a name to. Open a new name window in a suitable way: Right-click the selection and choose the Define Name option from the contextual menu, or click the Named ranges icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar and select the Define Name option from the menu. or click the  Named ranges button on the Formula tab of the top toolbar and select the Name manager option from the menu. Choose option New in the opened window. The New Name window will open: Enter the necessary Name in the text entry field. Note: a name cannot start with a number, contain spaces or punctuation marks. Underscores (_) are allowed. Case does not matter. Specify the name Scope. The Workbook scope is selected by default, but you can specify an individual worksheet selecting it from the list. Check the selected Data Range address. If necessary, you can change it. Click the icon - the Select Data Range window will open. Change the link to the cell range in the entry field or select a new range on the worksheet with the mouse and click OK. Click OK to save the new name. To quickly create a new name for the selected cell range, you can also enter the desired name into the name box located to the left of the the formula bar and press Enter. The name created in such a way is scoped to the Workbook. Manage names All the existing names can be accessed via the Name Manager. To open it: click the Named ranges icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar and select the Name manager option from the menu, or click the arrow in the name field and select the Name Manager option. The Name Manager window will open: For your convenience, you can filter the names selecting the name category you want to be displayed: All, Defined names, Table names, Names Scoped to Sheet or Names Scoped to Workbook. The names that belong to the selected category will be displayed in the list, the other names will be hidden. To change the sort order for the displayed list, you can click on the Named Ranges or Scope titles in this window. To edit a name, select it in the list and click the Edit button. The Edit Name window will open: For a defined name, you can change the name and the data range it refers to. For a table name, you can change the name only. When all the necessary changes are made, click OK to apply them. To discard the changes, click Cancel. If the edited name is used in a formula, the formula will be automatically changed accordingly. To delete a name, select it in the list and click the Delete button. Note: if you delete the name that is used in a formula, the formula will no longer work (it will return the #NAME? error). You can also create a new name in the Name Manager window by clicking the New button. Use names when working with the spreadsheet To quickly navigate through cell ranges, you can click the arrow in the name box and select the necessary name from the name list – the data range that corresponds to this name will be selected in the worksheet. Note: the name list displays the defined names and table names scoped to the current worksheet and to the whole workbook. To add a name as an argument of a formula: Place the insertion point where you need to add a name. Make one of the following steps: enter the name of the necessary named range manually using the keyboard. Once you type the initial letters, the Formula Autocomplete list will be displayed. As you type, the items (formulas and names) that match the entered characters are displayed in it. You can select the necessary defined name or table name from the list and insert it into the formula by double-clicking it or pressing the Tab key. or click the Named ranges icon on the Home tab of the top toolbar, select the Paste name option from the menu, choose the necessary name from the Paste Name window and click OK: Note: the Paste Name window displays the defined names and table names scoped to the current worksheet and to the whole workbook.
