            <h1>Protecting a spreadsheet</h1>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/spreadsheet-editor.aspx" target="_blank" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Spreadsheet Editor</b></a> gives you an opportunity to protect a shared spreadsheet when you intend to restrict access or editing abilities for other users. <b>Spreadsheet Editor</b> offers different levels of protection to control both access to the file and editing abilities inside a workbook and within the sheets. Use the <b>Protection</b> tab to configure the available protection options as you deem it appropriate.</p>
            <p><img alt="Protection tab" src="../images/interface/protectiontab.png" /></p>
            <p>The available protection options include:</p>
            <p><a href="../UsageInstructions/Password.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Encrypt</b></a> to control access to the file and prevent it from being opened by other users.</p>
            <p><a href="../UsageInstructions/ProtectWorkbook.htm#delimiteddata" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Protect workbook</b></a> to control user’s manipulations with the workbook and to prevent unwanted changes to the workbook structure.</p>
            <p><a href="../UsageInstructions/ProtectSheet.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Protect sheet</b></a> to control user’s actions within a sheet and to prevent unwanted changes to data.</p>
            <p><a href="../UsageInstructions/AllowEditRanges.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Allow edit ranges</b></a> to specify cell ranges a user can work with in a protected sheet.</p>
            <p>Use the <b>Protection</b> tab checkboxes to lock or unlock quickly the sheet contents in a protected sheet.</p>
            <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: these options will not take effect until you enable sheet protection.</p>
            <p>By default, the cells, the shapes and the text inside a shape are locked in a sheet, uncheck the appropriate checkbox to unlock them. The unlocked objects can still be edited when a sheet is protected. The options <b>Shape Locked</b> and <b>Lock Text</b> become active when a shape is selected. The <b>Shape Locked</b> option is applicable both to shapes and other objects such as charts, images and text boxes. The <b>Lock Text</b> option locks text inside all graphical objects except charts.</p>
            <p>Check the <b>Hidden Formulas</b> box to hide formulas in a selected range or cell when a sheet is protected. The hidden formula will not appear in the formula bar when you click the cell.<p>
