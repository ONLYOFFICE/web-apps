		<h1>Advanced Settings of the Spreadsheet Editor</h1>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/spreadsheet-editor.aspx" target="_blank" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)"><b>Spreadsheet Editor</b></a> allows you to change its general advanced settings. To access them, open the <b>File</b> tab on the top toolbar and select the <b>Advanced Settings...</b> option. You can also click the <b>View settings</b> <img alt="View settings icon" src="../images/viewsettingsicon.png" /> icon on the right side of the editor header and select the <b>Advanced settings</b> option.</p>
			<p>The <b>General</b> advanced settings are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Commenting Display</b> is used to turn on/off the live commenting option:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Turn on display of the comments</b> - if you disable this feature, the commented cells will be marked in the sheet only if you click the <b>Comments</b> <img alt="Comments icon" src="../images/commentsicon.png" /> icon on the left sidebar.</li>
                        <li><b>Turn on display of the resolved comments</b> - this feature is disabled by default to hide the resolved comments in the sheet. You can view such comments only if you click the <b>Comments</b> <img alt="Comments icon" src="../images/commentsicon.png" /> icon on the left sidebar. Enable this option if you want to display the resolved comments in the sheet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="onlineDocumentFeatures"><b>Autosave</b> is used in the <em>online version</em> to turn on/off automatic saving of changes made during the editing process.</span></li>
                <li><span class="desktopDocumentFeatures"><b>Autorecover</b> - is used in the <em>desktop version</em> to turn on/off the option that allows you to automatically recover spreadsheets if the program closes unexpectedly.</span></li>
                <li>
                    <b>Reference Style</b> is used to turn on/off the <b>R1C1 reference style</b>. By default, this option is disabled and the <b>A1 reference style</b> is used.
                    <p>When the <b>A1 reference style</b> is used, columns are designated by letters, and rows are designated by numbers. If you select the cell located in row 3 and column 2, its address displayed in the box to the left of the the formula bar looks like this: <b>B3</b>. If the <b>R1C1 reference style</b> is enabled, both rows and columns are designated by numbers. If you select the cell at the intersection of row 3 and column 2, its address will look like this: <b>R3C2</b>. Letter R indicates the row number and letter C indicates the column number.</p>
                    <p><img alt="Active cell" src="../images/activecell.png" /></p>
                    <p>In case you refer to other cells using the <b>R1C1 reference style</b>, the reference to a target cell is formed based on the distance from an active cell. For example, when you select the cell in row 5 and column 1 and refer to the cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is <b>R[-2]C[1]</b>. The numbers in square brackets designate the position of the cell relative to the current cell position, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows up and 1 column to the right of the active cell. If you select the cell in row 1 and column 2 and refer to the same cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is <b>R[2]C</b>, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows down from the active cell and in the same column.</p>
                    <p><img alt="Relative reference" src="../images/relativereference.png" /></p>
                </li>
                <li class="onlineDocumentFeatures">
                    <b>Co-editing Mode</b> is used to select how the changes made during the co-editing are displayed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>By default, the <b>Fast</b> mode is selected, and the co-authors will see all the changes in real time as soon as they are made by others.</li>
                        <li>If you prefer not to see the changes made by other users (so that they do not disturb you), select the <b>Strict</b> mode, and all the changes will be shown only after you click the <b>Save</b> <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon, and you will be informed that there are changes by other users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Interface theme</b> is used to change the color scheme of the editor’s interface.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Light</b> color scheme incorporates standard green, white, and light-gray colors with less contrast in UI elements suitable for working during daytime.</li>
                        <li><b>Classic Light</b> color scheme incorporates standard green, white, and light-gray colors.</li>
                        <li><b>Dark</b> color scheme incorporates black, dark-gray, and light-gray colors suitable for working during nighttime.
                    <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Apart from the available <b>Light</b>, <b>Classic Light</b>, and <b>Dark</b> interface themes, ONLYOFFICE editors can now be customized with your own color theme. Please follow <a target="_blank" href="https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-developer-change-theme.aspx" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">these instructions</a> to learn how you can do that.</p>
                    </li>                    
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Default Zoom Value</b> is used to set the default zoom value by selecting it in the list of available options from 50% to 500%.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Font Hinting</b> is used to specify how a font is displayed in the Spreadsheet Editor:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose <b>As Windows</b> if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on Windows, i.e. using Windows font hinting.</li>
                        <li>Choose <b>As OS X</b> if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on a Mac, i.e. without any font hinting at all.</li>
                        <li>Choose <b>Native</b> to display the text with hinting embedded into the font files.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Default cache mode</b> - used to select the cache mode for the font characters. It’s not recommended to switch it without any reason. It can be helpful in some cases only, for example, when an issue with the enabled hardware acceleration in the Google Chrome browser occurs.
                            <p>The Spreadsheet Editor has two cache modes:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In the <b>first cache mode</b>, each letter is cached as a separate picture.</li>
                                <li>In the <b>second cache mode</b>, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically and a mechanism of allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The <b>Default cache mode</b> setting applies two above mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When the <b>Default cache mode</b> setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the <b>second cache mode</b>, other browsers use the <b>first cache mode</b>.</li>
                                <li>When the <b>Default cache mode</b> setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the <b>first cache mode</b>, other browsers use the <b>second cache mode</b>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Unit of Measurement</b> is used to specify what units are used for measuring elements parameters such as width, height, spacing, margins etc. You can select the <b>Centimeter</b>, <b>Point</b>, or <b>Inch</b> option.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Formula Language</b> is used to select the language for displaying and entering formula names, argument names and descriptions.
                    <p><b>Formula language</b> is supported for 32 languages:</p>

                <li><b>Separator</b> is used to specify the characters that you want to use as separators for decimals and thousands.

                <li><b>Cut, copy and paste</b> - used to show the <b>Paste Options</b> button when content is pasted. Check the box to enable this feature.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Macros Settings</b> - used to set macros display with a notification.
                    <ul>
